Shlykov, a hard-working taxi driver and Lyosha, a saxophonist, develop a bizarre love-hate relationship, and despite their prejudices, realize they aren't so different after all.
The nation of Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts.
As punishment for a past rebellion, each district must provide a boy and girl  between the ages of 12 and 18 selected by lottery  for the annual Hunger Games.
The tributes must fight to the death in an arena; the sole survivor is rewarded with fame and wealth.
In her first Reaping, 12-year-old Primrose Everdeen is chosen from District 12.
Her older sister Katniss volunteers to take her place.
Peeta Mellark, a baker's son who once gave Katniss bread when she was starving, is the other District 12 tribute.
Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, accompanied by their frequently drunk mentor, past victor Haymitch Abernathy.
He warns them about the "Career" tributes who train intensively at special academies and almost always win.
During a TV interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta unexpectedly reveals his love for Katniss.
She is outraged, believing it to be a ploy to gain audience support, as "sponsors" may provide in-Games gifts of food, medicine, and tools.
However, she discovers Peeta meant what he said.
The televised Games begin with half of the tributes killed in the first few minutes; Katniss barely survives ignoring Haymitch's advice to run away from the melee over the tempting supplies and weapons strewn in front of a structure called the Cornucopia.
Peeta forms an uneasy alliance with the four Careers.
They later find Katniss and corner her up a tree.
Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, draws her attention to a poisonous tracker jacker nest hanging from a branch.
Katniss drops it on her sleeping besiegers.
They all scatter, except for Glimmer, who is killed by the insects.
Hallucinating due to tracker jacker venom, Katniss is warned to run away by Peeta.
Rue cares for Katniss for a couple of days until she recovers.
Meanwhile, the alliance has gathered all the supplies into a pile.
Katniss has Rue draw them off, then destroys the stockpile by setting off the mines planted around it.
Furious, Cato kills the boy assigned to guard it.
As Katniss runs from the scene, she hears Rue calling her name.
She finds Rue trapped and releases her.
Marvel, a tribute from District 1, throws a spear at Katniss, but she dodges the spear, causing it to stab Rue in the stomach instead.
Katniss shoots him dead with an arrow.
She then comforts the dying Rue with a song.
Afterward, she gathers and arranges flowers around Rue's body.
When this is televised, it sparks a riot in Rue's District 11.
President Snow summons Seneca Crane, the Gamemaker, to express his displeasure at the way the Games are turning out.
Since Katniss and Peeta have been presented to the public as "star-crossed lovers", Haymitch is able to convince Crane to make a rule change to avoid inciting further riots.
It is announced that tributes from the same district can win as a pair.
Upon hearing this, Katniss searches for Peeta and finds him with an infected sword wound in the leg.
She portrays herself as deeply in love with him and gains a sponsor's gift of soup.
An announcer proclaims a feast, where the thing each survivor needs most will be provided.
Peeta begs her not to risk getting him medicine.
Katniss promises not to go, but after he falls asleep, she heads to the feast.
Clove ambushes her and pins her down.
As Clove gloats, Thresh, the other District 11 tribute, kills Clove after overhearing her tormenting Katniss about killing Rue.
He spares Katniss "just this time...for Rue".
The medicine works, keeping Peeta mobile.
Foxface, the girl from District 5, dies from eating nightlock berries she stole from Peeta; neither knew they are highly poisonous.
Crane changes the time of day in the arena to late at night and unleashes a pack of hound-like creatures to speed things up.
They kill Thresh and force Katniss and Peeta to flee to the roof of the Cornucopia, where they encounter Cato.
After a battle, Katniss wounds Cato with an arrow and Peeta hurls him to the creatures below.
Katniss shoots Cato to spare him a prolonged death.
With Peeta and Katniss apparently victorious, the rule change allowing two winners is suddenly revoked.
Peeta tells Katniss to shoot him.
Instead, she gives him half of the nightlock.
However, before they can commit suicide, they are hastily proclaimed the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.
Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made powerful enemies after her display of defiance.
She and Peeta return to District 12, while Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries, and President Snow considers the situation.
Poovalli Induchoodan  is sentenced for six years prison life for murdering his classmate.
Induchoodan, the only son of Justice Maranchery Karunakara Menon  was framed in the case by Manapally Madhavan Nambiar  and his crony DYSP Sankaranarayanan  to take revenge on idealist judge Menon who had earlier given jail sentence to Manapally in a corruption case.
Induchoodan, who had achieved top rank in Indian Civil Service loses the post and Manapally Sudheeran ([[Saikumar  enters the list of civil service trainees.
We learn in flashback that it was Ramakrishnan  
the son of Moopil Nair , who had actually killed his classmate.
Six years passes by and Manapally Madhavan Nambiar, now a former state minister, is dead and Induchoodan, who is all rage at the gross injustice meted out to him - thus destroying his promising life, is released from prison.
Induchoodan thwarts
Manapally Pavithran  from performing the funeral rituals of Nambiar at Bharathapuzha.
Many confrontations between Induchoodan and Manapally's henchmen follow.
Induchoodan also falls in love with Anuradha ([[Aishwarya , the strong-willed and independent-minded daughter of Mooppil Nair.
Justice Menon and his wife returns back to Kerala to stay with Induchoodan.
There is an appearance of a girl named Indulekha ([[Kanaka , who claims to be the daughter of Justice Menon.
Menon flatly refuses the claim and banishes her.
Forced by circumstances and at the instigation and help of Manapally Pavithran, she reluctantly come out open with the claim.
Induchoodan at first thrashes the protesters.
But upon knowing the truth from Chandrabhanu his uncle, he accepts the task of her protection in the capacity as elder brother.
Induchoodan decides to marry off Indulekha to his good friend Jayakrishnan .
Induchoodan has a confrontation with his father and prods him to accept mistake and acknowledge the parentage of Indulekha.
Menon ultimately regrets and goes on to confess to his daughter.
The very next day, when Induchoodan returns to Poovally, Indulekha is found dead and Menon is accused of murdering her.
The whole act was planned by Pavithran, who after killing Indulekha, forces Raman Nair  to testify against Menon in court.
In court, Nandagopal Maarar , a close friend of Induchoodan and a famous supreme court lawyer, appears for Menon and manages to lay bare the murder plot and hidden intentions of other party .
Menon is judged innocent of the crime by court.
After confronting Pavithran and promising just retribution to the crime of killing Indulekha, Induchoodan returns to his father, who now shows remorse for all his actions including not believing in the innocence of his son.
But while speaking to Induchoodan, Menon suffers a heart stroke and passes away.
At Menon's funeral, Manapally Pavithran arrives to poke fun at Induchoodan and he also tries to carry out the postponed last rituals of his own father.
Induchoodan interrupts the ritual and avenges for the death of his sister and father by severely injuring Pavithran.
On his way back to peaceful life, Induchoodan accepts Anuradha as his life partner.
The Lemon Drop Kid , a New York City swindler, is illegally touting horses at a Florida racetrack.
After several successful hustles, the Kid comes across a beautiful, but gullible, woman intending to bet a lot of money.
The Kid convinces her to switch her bet, employing a prefabricated con.
Unfortunately for the Kid, the woman "belongs" to notorious gangster Moose Moran , as does the money.
The Kid's choice finishes dead last and a furious Moran
demands the Kid provide him with $10,000  by Christmas Eve, or the Kid "won't make it to New Year's.
The Kid decides to return to New York to try to come up with the money.
He first tries his on-again, off-again girlfriend Brainy Baxter .
However, when talk of long-term commitment arises, the Kid quickly makes an escape.
He next visits local crime boss "Oxford" Charley , with whom he has had past dealings.
This falls through as Charley is in serious tax trouble and does not particularly care for the Kid anyway.
As he leaves Charley's establishment and is about to give up hope, the Kid notices a cornerside Santa Claus and his kettle.
Thinking quickly, the Kid fashions himself a Santa suit and begins collecting donations.
This fails as he is recognized by a passing policeman, who remembers his previous underhanded activity well.
The Kid lands in court, where he is convicted of collecting for a charity without a license and sentenced to ten days in jail .
However, while in court, the Kid learns where his scheme went wrong.
After a short stay, Brainy arrives to bail him out.
He then sets about restarting his Santa operation, this time with legitimate backing.
To this end, he needs a charity to represent and a city license.
The kid receives key inspiration when he remembers that Nellie Thursday , a kindly neighborhood resident, has been denied entry to a retirement home because of her jailed husband's criminal past as a safecracker.
Organizing other small-time New York swindlers and Brainy, who is both surprised and charmed at the Kid's apparent goodwill, the Kid converts an abandoned casino  into the "Nellie Thursday Home For Old Dolls".
A small group of elderly women and makeshift amenities complete the project.
The Kid is able to receive the all-important city license.
Now free to collect, the Kid and his compatriots dress as Santa Claus and position themselves throughout Manhattan.
The others are unaware that the Kid plans to keep the money for himself to pay off Moran.
The scheme is a huge success, netting $2,000 in only a few days.
An overjoyed Brainy decides to leave her job as a dancer and look after the "home" full-time until after Christmas.
Coincidentally, her employer is none other than "Oxford" Charley, whom Brainy cheerfully informs of the effort.
Seeing a potential gold mine, Charley decides to muscle in on the operation.
Reasoning that the Nellie Thursday home is "wherever Nellie Thursday is", Charley and his crew kidnap the home's inhabitants  and move them to Charley's mansion in Nyack.
The Kid learns of this when he returns to the home after a late night to find the home deserted and money  gone.
Clued in by oversized Oxford footprints in the snow, the Kid and his friends pay Charley a visit.
Here, Charley reveals the true nature of the Kid's scheme through a phone conversation with Moose Moran.
The Kid's accomplices are angry and move to confront him, but the Kid manages to slip away.
However, Brainy tracks him down outside and voices her disgust at his actions.
After a few days of stewing in self-pity , the Kid is surprised to meet Nellie, who has escaped Charley's compound.
He decides to recover the money, sneaking into Charley's home in the guise of an elderly woman.
He finds that Charley and his crew are again moving the women, this time to a more secure location.
Using the heightened activity to his advantage, the Kid enters Charley's office and confronts him.
After a brief struggle, the Kid overpowers Charley and makes off with the money, narrowly avoiding the thugs Charley has sent after him.
The ensuing chaos allows Brainy and the others to escape.
Later that night, the Kid returns to the original Nellie Thursday home to meet with Moose Moran .
The deal appears to be in jeopardy as Moran arrives with Charley.
Charley demands that the Kid reimburse him, which would leave too little for Moran.
However, the Kid turns the tables by hitting a switch, revealing hidden casino tables.
All are occupied, mainly by the escaped old dolls.
The Kid and his still-loyal friends hold off the gangsters as the police initiate a raid.
Moran and Charley are arrested while the judge who sentenced the Kid earlier warns that he will be "keeping an eye on him".
The Kid assures him that will not be necessary and his attention will lie on the home, which is going to become a reality.
The night's main event begins as Nellie's husband Henry, free on parole, joyously reunites with his wife.
Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Outback.
With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard.
Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches.
When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success.
It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.
The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains.
For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her.
Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact.
The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media report a rumour that the name Azaria means "sacrifice in the wilderness" , the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite.
Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and a lot of circumstantial evidence—including a small wooden coffin Michael uses as a receptacle for his parishioners' packs of un-smoked cigarettes—and reopen the investigation, and eventually Lindy is charged with murder.
Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play on the jury's sympathy and appears emotionless on the stand, convincing onlookers she is guilty of the crime of which she is accused.
As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife disintegrate, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth.
In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month suspended sentence.
More than three years later, while searching for the body of an English tourist who fell from Uluru, police discover a small item of clothing that is identified as the jacket Lindy had insisted Azaria was wearing over her jumpsuit, which had been recovered early in the investigation.
She is immediately released from prison, the case reopened and all convictions against the Chamberlains overturned.
The president is on his way to give a speech.
While he is traveling there a man shows up with a camera.
A reporter tries to ask a member of the secret service a question.
When the president enters he is shot by the man with the camera.
The president's main bodyguard, Alex Thomas , is grazed by the bullet that hits the president.
The shooter is gunned down by Alex and other secret service agents.
The president dies at the hospital.
Kate Crawford , an investigative journalist, starts asking questions about the assassination.
Anyone she questions is killed.
She goes to Alex Thomas's house to tell him what is happening.
As they head to his boat, Thomas sees some men hiding in the bushes.
He throws Kate into the water and dives in.
Thomas jumps out of the water to kill two of the hitmen while a third hitman drives off to inform his boss what happened.
They are able to link the hitmen to a man called Jack Baldwin .
Agent Thomas and other Secret Service members attack the location of Jack Baldwin.
Baldwin escapes but is later caught by Thomas.
Thomas and Crawford are suspicious of Vaughan Stevens , Agent Thomas's boss, who had previous links to Baldwin.
While reviewing film of the assassination at his house, Thomas discovers that Stevens handed the assassin a gun during the president's entrance.
Thomas leaves to find Stevens while Kate stays at his house.
When Thomas arrives at Stevens' home he finds him dead.
Before entering, Thomas sees a car leaving the house.
He then receives a call that Baldwin has escaped.
Kate is attacked by Baldwin but Thomas arrives and kills Baldwin.
Thomas arrives at the first lady's  home to see the car that left Steven's house pulling away.
Thomas discovers that the first lady wanted her husband killed - due to the fact that the President was being unfaithful to her.
A few weeks later Kate and Thomas have dinner.
Thomas says that he still doesn't know who wanted the President dead.
{{plot}}
The film opens in 1974, as a young girl, Dahlia, stands outside after school in the rain, waiting for her mother.
Flash forward to 2005, we see a grown-up Dahlia  in the midst of a bitter mediation with ex-husband, Kyle , over custody of their daughter, Cecilia .
Kyle wants Cecilia to live closer to his apartment in Jersey City, but Dahlia wants to move to Roosevelt Island, where she has found a good school.
Kyle threatens to sue for full custody because he feels the distance is too great.
He also claims that Dahlia is "mentally unstable.
" Dahlia and Cecilia see an apartment in a complex on Roosevelt Island, which is just a few blocks from Cecilia's new school.
The superintendent of the dilapidated building is Mr. Veeck .
The manager is Mr. Murray .
During the tour, Cecilia sneaks to the roof where she finds a Hello Kitty backpack near a large water tank.
They leave the bag with Veeck, and Murray promises Cecilia that she can have it if no one claims it.
Cecilia, who had disliked the apartment, now wants desperately to live there.
Dahlia agrees to move in.
Shortly after, the bedroom ceiling begins to leak dark water.
The source is the apartment above, 10F, where the Rimsky family lived up until a month ago.
Dahlia enters 10F and finds it flooded, with dark water flowing from every faucet, the walls and toilet.
She finds a family portrait of the former tenants—a mother, father, and a girl Cecilia's age.
Dahlia complains to both Veeck and Murray about the water, but the former does little about it despite the insistence of the latter.
Dahlia soon has dreams of a little girl who appears to be Cecilia returning from a visit to her father's home, but the girl's appearance changes every time Dahlia looks away, so that she looks like the girl in the portrait in 10F.
Cecilia has started school, but according to her new teacher , she isn't fitting in and is spending too much time with an imaginary friend, named Natasha.
A psychologist is recommended, but Dahlia declines and tells Cecilia to ignore Natasha.
Although Veeck had said it was claimed, Dahlia discovers the Hello Kitty backpack in the laundry room's garbage.
Cecilia later finds it in the elevator.
The name in the backpack reads "Natasha Rimsky".
The ceiling, shoddily patched by Veeck, leaks again.
At school, Cecilia appears to get into a fight with Natasha, who appears to control her hand while painting.
She's taken to the girls' bathroom where she passes out after dark water gushes from the toilets and sinks.
Dahlia, who is meeting with her lawyer, can't be reached, so Kyle picks her up and takes her to his apartment.
Dahlia breaks down when she can't find her daughter and has strange dreams.
These lead her to the roof and up the ladder of the water tank, where she finds Natasha's body.
When police arrive, they discover that Natasha's father thought she was with her mother, while the mother thought the girl was with her father.
The girl was left alone in the abandoned apartment and fell into the water tank, which Veeck had left open.
He was aware of her body, which was why he refused to fix the water problem plaguing the complex.
Veeck is arrested and Murray is questioned.
Dahlia agrees to move closer to Kyle so shared custody will go easier.
As Dahlia packs, Cecilia is taking a bath.
A girl in a hooded bathrobe comes out of the bathroom, wanting Dahlia to read to her.
When she hears voices in the bathroom, she realizes that the girl is Natasha.
Natasha begs Dahlia not to leave her, but Dahlia rushes into the bathroom to save Cecilia.
Natasha then locks Cecilia in the shower compartment and holds her underwater.
Dahlia pleads with Natasha, promising to be her mother forever.
Natasha lets Cecilia go and floods the apartment, causing Dahlia to die from drowning.
Her and Natasha's spirits are shown walking down the hallway.
Kyle picks up Cecilia from the police station.
Weeks later, the two go back to pick up the rest of her stuff.
Cecilia has a flashback of her and her mother looking at pictures together, and in the elevator, her mother's ghost braids her hair and comforts her—telling her she will always be there.
Kyle, momentarily horrified with a malfunction in the elevator, the weird behavior of his daughter, and perhaps noticing her hair had been braided, finally takes her to his apartment in Jersey City.
The story begins with Hannah, a young Jewish teen, as she is completing her senior year of high school.
Her small neighborhood in Brooklyn is falling apart and SING!
is one of the only traditions keeping the neighborhood alive.
Newly arrived teacher, Miss Lombardo grew up in the neighborhood but returned to be their Sing Leader.
One cold Christmas night, Miss Lombardo is leaving a neighborhood party when a young man hails her a cab, then attempts to mug her.
In self defense, she bites his hand to release his grip and he screams in pain and terror, quickly making an exit.
The cab driver jokes about not starting the meter yet.
On the first day of school, Miss Lombardo runs into difficulty when her students are uninterested and misbehaved.
One such student was named Dominic who gets scolded for bringing stolen watches to school grounds and putting his feet up on the desk.
On the day of Sing Leader elections, Miss Lombardo recognizes Dominic as her mugger by the bandage on his hand and decides to blackmail him into being co-Sing Leader of the Senior class along with Hannah, who was rightfully elected.
The school kids work hard to plan their Sing productions.
Hannah and Dominic clash along the way as Hannah uses traditional Sing planning strategies while Dominic wants to introduce the flavor of the youth in the neighborhood.
In order to put Dominic and Hannah on the same page, Miss Lombardo suggests that Hannah accompany Dominic to a local club.
At first, the two are equally hesitant but Hannah agrees on the terms that it is not a date.
However, by the end of the night, Hannah uses Dominic to make her ex boyfriend, Mickey, jealous, and due to this, Hannah and Dominic start seeing each other in a different light.
Dominic accompanies Hannah on her walk home and the two share a romantic kiss.
Once the two are finally uniting and getting along, the Dept. of Education informs the school that it will close its doors forever at the end of this semester and therefore, there will not be enough resources for them to complete this year's Sing.
This fuels the kids to work even harder on their productions and the neighborhood comes together even more to help finance the show, despite the school authorities' ban.
Ironically, just as things are starting to look up, Dominic reluctantly accompanies his brother on a robbery of Hannah's mother's diner, their sole source of income which already was at risk of failure due to the school's upcoming closure.
A classmate saw Dominic standing outside the diner at the time of the crime and informed Hannah of what he saw.
Devastated, Hannah confronts Dominic and he promises to get the money back for her.
He then steals the money back from his brother and returns it to the diner, restoring Hannah's faith in him.
The recent events had discouraged Dominic from fulfilling his co-Sing leader duties and he had been skipping out on rehearsals.
In a moment of great need as the senior's main performer falls unconscious, Dominic steps in to save the show.
He sheds his bad-boy demeanor and exceeds all expectations.
The underclassmen and seniors perform to a record-high sold out audience.
At the end of the show, Hannah makes a moving speech motivating the community to rejoice and always remember that despite compromising circumstances, they completed a successful Sing and proved their community's worth.
Infuriated at being told to write one final column after being laid off from her newspaper job, Ann Mitchell  prints a letter from a fictional unemployed "John Doe" threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society's ills.
When the note causes a sensation and the paper's competition suspects a fraud and starts to investigate, the newspaper editor rehires Mitchell who comes up with a scheme of hiding the fictional nature of "John Doe" while exploiting the sensation caused by the fake letter to boost the newspaper's sales, for which she demands a bonus equal to 8 months' pay.
After reviewing a number of derelicts who have shown up at the paper claiming to have penned the original suicide letter, Mitchell and editor Henry Connell  hire John Willoughby , a former baseball player and tramp who is in need of money to repair his injured arm, to play John Doe.
Mitchell now starts to pen an article series in Doe's name, elaborating on the letter's ideas of society's disregard of people in need.
Willoughby gets $50, a new suit of clothes, and a plush hotel suite with his tramp friend , who launches into an extended diatribe against "the heelots", lots of heels who incessantly focus on getting money from others.
Willoughby is hired to give radio speeches, guided by Mitchell who is promised $100 a week to write his speeches, paid by the newspaper's publisher, D.B. Norton
([[Edward Arnold .
Willoughby turns down a $5,000 bribe to admit the whole thing was a publicity stunt, gives Mitchell's speech, and dashes off to the countryside with "The Colonel".
They ride the rails, playing the harmonica and ocarina until they show up in Millsville, where John Doe is recognized at a diner.
He's brought to City Hall, where he's met by Hanson, who gives a five-minute monologue about how he was inspired to start a local John Doe club.
The John Doe philosophy spreads across the country, developing into a broad grassroots movement whose simple slogan is, "Be a better neighbor".
Far from being an altruistic philanthropist, however, Norton plans to channel the support for Doe into support for his own national political ambitions.
As a culmination of this plan, Norton has instructed Mitchell to write a speech for Willoughby in which he announces the foundation of a new political party and endorses Norton as its presidential candidate.
When Willoughby, who has come to believe in the John Doe philosophy himself, realizes that he is being used, he tries to expose the plot, but is first stymied in his attempts to talk his own mind to a nationwide radio audience at the rally instead of reading the prepared speech, and then exposed as a fake by Norton, who claims to have been deceived, like everyone else, by the staff of the newspaper.
Frustrated by his failure, Willoughby intends to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the City Hall on Christmas Eve, as indicated in the original John Doe letter.
Only the intervention of Mitchell and followers of the John Doe clubs persuades him to renege on his threat to kill himself.
At this point in the movie, a reference to Jesus Christ is made, that a historical "John Doe" has already died for the sake of humanity.
The film ends with Connell turning to Norton and saying, "There you are, Norton!
The people!
Try and lick that!"
A line of people  drool at the window of the shop of market butcher Buzz Buzzard.
A short series of gags ensues about how Buzz dishonestly  "jacks" up all his prices.
Since Woody is broke as usual, he sneaks in and gets thrown out by Buzz.
On the way out, Woody collides with a bottle of invisible ink and turns partially invisible.
Buzz can only see parts of Woody's body, and, in a somewhat gruesome scene, thinks that he's been dismembered, so he sweeps him into a trap door to get rid of him.
When Woody awakes, he realizes what is happening, and he douses himself with the rest of the ink in order to pose as a ghost.

Still angry about the previous night, Lola kicks
Bo out once more and proceeds to marry for the money.
Fortunately for her, she trusts Bo's words and turns the tables on Simona and Marco, and also turns down the money from her father and departs, claiming that money ruined the family long before that day.
She does not want the money if it means turning into a selfish and greedy person like her father.  
At the end of the film, Bo is working as a bartender, where Lola manages to find him.
They reconcile and show their love for each other once again, and they remain together and happy.

Bumbling pirate crewman  kills his captain after learning where he has hidden buried treasure.
However as he begins to lose his memory, he relies more and more on the ghost of the man he's murdered to help him find the treasure.
This film provided a reunion of sorts for Sellers with his onetime Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan, who appears halfway through the film.
The film is based on the events that happened on the ship Exodus in 1947 as well as events dealing with the founding of the state of Israel in 1948.
Nurse Katherine "Kitty" Fremont  is an American volunteer at the Karaolos internment camp on Cyprus, where thousands of Jews - Holocaust survivors - are being held by the British, who won't let them go to Palestine.
They anxiously wait for the day they will be liberated.
Ari Ben Canaan , a Hagannah rebel who previously was a captain in the Jewish Brigade of the British Army in the Second World War, obtains a cargo ship and smuggles 611 Jewish inmates out of the camp for an illegal voyage to Mandate Palestine before being discovered by military authorities.
When the British find out that the refugees are in a ship in the harbor of Famagusta, they blockade it.
The refugees stage a hunger strike, during which the camp's doctor dies, and Ari threatens to blow up the ship and the refugees.
The British relent and allow the Exodus safe passage.
Meanwhile, Kitty has grown very fond of Karen Hansen , a young Danish-Jewish girl searching for her father, from whom she was separated during the war.
She has taken up the Zionist cause, much to the chagrin of Kitty, who had hoped to take young Karen to America so that she can begin a new life there.
During this time, opposition to the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states is heating up, and Karen's young beau Dov Landau  proclaims his desire to join the Irgun, a radical Zionist underground network.
Dov goes to an Irgun address, only to get caught in a police trap.
After he is freed, he is contacted by members of the Irgun and is interviewed by Ari Ben Canaan's uncle Akiva .
Before swearing Dov in, Akiva forces the boy to confess that he was a Sonderkommando in Auschwitz and that he was raped by Nazis.
Due to his activities, Akiva has been disowned by Ari's father, Barak , who heads the mainstream Jewish Agency trying to create a Jewish state through political and diplomatic means.
He fears that the Irgun will damage his efforts, especially since the British have put a price on Akiva's head.
When Dov successfully bombs the King David Hotel in an act of terrorism, leading to dozens of fatalities, Akiva is arrested and sentenced to hang.
Meanwhile, Karen's father has been found, but he is ill in hospital in Jerusalem and does not recognize her.
Karen has gone to live at Gan Dafna, a fictional Jewish kibbutz near Mount Tabor at which Ari was raised.
An actual kibbutz named Dafna is located near the present Lebanese border.
Kitty and Ari have fallen in love, but uncle Akiva's imprisonment is an obstacle, and Ari must devise a plan to free the prisoners.
Dov Landau, who had managed to elude the arresting soldiers, turns himself in so that he can use his knowledge of explosives to rig the Acre prison and plan an escape route.
All goes according to plan; hundreds of prisoners, including Akiva, manage to escape.
For the historical incident on which this is based, see Acre Prison break.
Akiva is fatally shot by British soldiers while evading a roadblock set up to catch the escaped prisoners.
Ari is also badly wounded.

{{plot}} Following the sudden death of Kid's father "Pop" the local church has donated a scholarship fund to Kid so that he can go to college.
Play now drives a sports car called "Foreplay" and is the manager of a record store.
He attracts the attention of music producer Shelia Landreaux whose talent scout Rick spotted Kid N' Play performing at a community center.
Shelia is willing to help finance Kid N'Play's demo session if they can commit to taking the act to the top of the charts.
Kid however immediately backs out because he can't commit to the act and go to school, causing a rift between the two friends.
Kid and Sydney both move into new student accommodations where Kid's room mate is Jamal, a white rapper and Sydney moves in with Zora, a strong minded female student who embraces strong political correctness.
Meanwhile, Play meets a beautiful older woman named Salena who he flirts with and offers to help her with any thing she needs.
Unfortunately, Bilal arrives and causes Play to stop flirting with Salena
but she assures him that she'll back.
Zora encourages Sydney to take courses that focus on more feminist perspectives and slowly Kid and Sydney begin to drift apart.
While buying books for his studies, Kid's tuition cheque bounces and he is sent to the finance office where first he meets Miles, the Dean's assistant who tells him not to be intimidated.
Kid calls Play  about his money and Play quickly assures him that his money is in a safe place.
Back on campus, Kid then meets Dean Kramer who destroys Kid's student ID and gives him a week to pay his tuition fee.
Miles tells Kid he can "hook him up" with an extension by getting his friend to make changes on the main computer for a small price.
Kid gives Miles all the money he has left for the hook up.
Meanwhile, Shelia Landreaux approaches Play after Rick apparently takes off with the money that was supposedly for Kid n' Play's demo session
so he can clear his gambling debts.
Play hesitantly gives Shelia Kid's scholarship cheque and faces a grilling from Bilal.
Kid arrives later on demanding answers from Play as to the whereabouts of his money.
Play comes clean to Kid and convinces him to ride to the recording studio where he promises Shelia will be with the money.
Kid, Play and Bilal arrive at "Do Me Records" but are denied access into the building as the secretary has not heard of the names Shelia Landreaux or Play.
Play is then confronted by Stab, Zilla and Pee Wee who want to know when they are going to record their demo.
The trio were led to believe that Shelia gave Play their money for their demo session.
As everyone argues the police arrive and warn them never to give money to any women by the name of Shelia Landreaux who also goes by several other alias'.
Kid and Play get into a fight and Bilal then convinces Kid to ask Sydney for money.
Kid tries to approache Sydney but Sydney
assumes that he wants to break up with her.
Kid doesn't know how to tell her why he really approached her
so the two decide to stop seeing each other.
Kid takes a job in the faculty dining hall to make ends meet.
Things get worse when his lecturer, Professor Sinclair, gives him a week to write a 20 page paper or face failing his class.
However without a student ID and with Stab, Zilla and Pee Wee working as campus security Kid can no longer get into the library or cafeteria and relies on Jamal for support as he balances work and study.
Meanwhile, Play's new girlfriend Salena comes by angry at Play for not calling her about the demo.
He assures her he'll let her know as soon as possible.
Later, Bilal, who frequently convinces Play to give him personal discounts on records reminds him one day that "sometimes you've gotta pay what you owe".
Play then approaches Kid with a plan to make the money back:
A Pajama party where men pay entry fee and women "appropriately dressed" get in for free.
However, Play and Bilal run amok on campus such as Bilal having sex with a stranger girl and Kid walking in on Play and Salena in his dorm.
Play wants to hold the party in the faculty dining hall which would mean Kid having to get the key and risk getting into trouble with his boss Mr Lee.
Kid is against this idea and instead tries to reconcile with Sydney but sees her getting close to Miles at a protest rally.
After Mr Lee is informed that Kid is no longer a student he is dismissed of his duties and sent back to Dean Kramer.
Kid manages to get his deadline extended another week giving him enough time to plan for the party.
Kid, Play, Bilal and Jamal begin spreading word on campus about the party.
Later on the party is in full swing.
Sydney arrives hoping to talk to Kid but after seeing him getting close to another student she decides to go with Miles.
Zora is approached by Rick and Shelia who is now going by another alias.
While Kid N'Play perform on stage, Kid is distracted by Miles who forces Sydney into drinking beer.
He jumps off stage to rescue Sydney.
Play spots Shelia and Rick and chases after them.
Zora knocks Shelia out with a punch to the face while Sydney tries to get away from Miles.
Miles eventually lets go off Sydney and runs off with Kid in hot pursuit.
A chase occurs around the building involving Kid, Miles, Rick, Play and campus security.
Kid finally confronts Miles on the roof who tries to swing at Kid but falls through the glass roof and lands flat in huge cake.
The party is eventually stopped by Dean Kramer and the police.
Miles tries to escape but he is caught by Stab, Zilla, and Pee-Wee.
The police try to arrest them but Play explains the whole situation to Dean Kramer, who promptly fires Miles and has Rick and Shelia arrested instead.
He then tells Kid that the room needs to be changed back to the way it was by morning or face expulsion.
As Kid, Play, Bilal and Jamal frantically clean up Kid is approached by Mr Lee.
A reluctant Play gives Kid the money they made and Kid hands it over to Mr Lee hoping it will pay for the damages.
The next day Kid informs Mr Lee and then Professor Sinclair of his departure citing that he hadn't proven
he belonged at college.
Professor Sinclair had thought otherwise revealing he had given Kid an A minus for his 20 page paper.
He offers Kid a job as his teaching assistant but Kid declines because it wouldn't cover all his expenses.
Kid heads over to Pops grave where he apologizes for letting him down.
Play attempts to talk to Kid
but he is too upset.
Kid then packs up the rest of his stuff and says goodbye to Jamal and Sydney.
He also finally wins the respect of Stab, Zilla and Pee Wee.
They ride pass and tell him they got a job working on the police force.
Play and Bilal pull up with their girlfriends in Play's old car.
Play sold "Foreplay" and gives the money to Kid.
He admits to being the one who forced Kid to drop out of college in the first place and apologizes.
Play tells Kid to go back inside and study.
As Play and Bilal drive away, Kid looks up to the heavens and says thanks to Pop.

Ashes to Ashes is set in London, England.
The film is a surreal journey into the dreams and misadventures of Gabriel Darbeaux a young screenwriter and martial arts enthusiast who supplements his income by escorting wealthy women.
We are introduced to Gabriel’s character as he is chased and cornered by a group of Triad thugs armed with swords, sticks and nunchaku.
Using his own nunchaku Gabriel manages to fight off the thugs only to find that the whole episode was an early morning dream.
The dream provides inspiration for the opening scene of his latest screenplay entitled ‘Ashes to Ashes’ a thriller involving the Italian Mafia, Chinese Triads and a generous amount of martial arts action.
While Gabriel believes that the success of this script will give him financial independence, his best friend Michael has plans of setting up his own escort agency.
To fund this project, he resorts to making secret recordings of his sexual encounters with a banker’s wife and hopes to earn £100,000 through blackmail.
Gabriel receives a call to meet with one of his regular clients at an exclusive restaurant in the West End of London.
The woman fails to show and instead Gabriel encounters the beautiful Arabella Simone who draws him into a world which is disturbingly similar to that featured in his screenplay for Ashes to Ashes.
Arabella is the former mistress to Valentino Tarantola, a possessive Italian gangster who employs ‘Laundrymen’ Muhammed and Nelson to do his dirty work.
When Valentino is apparently castrated and left for dead at Arabella’s apartment she runs to Gabriel for help with the ‘Laundrymen’ close on her tail.
Michael is called in to drive the two to a main line station from where they plan to take a train to France.
Unfortunately, before the trio get very far, they are captured by the ‘Laundrymen’ and taken to a warehouse where they are introduced to Enrico Tarontola, Valentino’s sadistic younger brother.
Bound and gagged, they are forced to listen helplessly as Enrico accuses Arabella of castrating and killing his brother Valentino and Michael of blackmailing his financial advisor’s wife.
All three, including Gabriel are to be put to a violent death.
Without warning, henchmen of a rival Triad boss storm the warehouse.
In the ensuing battle, Gabriel is forced to fight for his life against Triad enforcers and Mafia hitmen.
The film ends with Gabriel waking from a violent dream blurring the distinction between dream, reality and the fictional account that Gabriel is writing.

Set in a lonely city on a rainy night, the film takes place in a bicycle shop  that is closed for the night.
In the corner of the shop sleeps Red, a red unicycle who languishes in the "clearance corner", waiting to be purchased.
As the camera zooms on him, the sound of rain falling turns into a drumroll, and we go into the dream-sequence.
In his dream, Red is being ridden by a circus clown  as part of a juggling act.
The clown enters the ring, accompanied by a fanfare, expecting a huge applause, but instead receives only a few scattered claps from different parts of the  audience.
Nevertheless, Lumpy starts juggling three balls whilst riding Red, occasionally dropping them as he does.
However, Red slides out from underneath Lumpy  and spikes the balls back to him with his bike pedals.
The confused clown ponders this for only a second before continuing on with his act.
At this point, Red is forced to catch another ball which Lumpy unintentionally throws across the ring.
Lumpy continues to ride in the air while juggling the other two balls while Red bounces the green ball up and down.
Eventually Lumpy comes to a sudden realization, and looks between his legs, only to discover he's been riding on nothing before he falls to the ground .
Red catches the other two balls and begins juggling all three of them, and then balances them on top of each other, after which he receives an uproarous applause.
But then the sound of clapping turns into the sound of rain, and Red awakens, left to face bleak reality.
Depressed, he returns to the corner where he was previously resting, and goes back to sleep.
The short ends with the final image of the neon sign for "Eben's Bikes".

This story of a Zulu family is a composite story of events enacted by Africans whose experiences resembled the story’s events.
Forced out of his village by famine, Zachariah leaves his family to take the only work available: in the gold mines near Johannesburg.
Seeking better than a slave wage, he settles with his wife and children in a bleak room in a crumbling shack on the outskirts of the city.
Here he confronts the pass laws – hundreds of laws which he did not know existed – restricting his every move: he cannot find work without a pass, and he cannot get a pass without work.
At the same time he is constantly threatened with banishment or imprisonment if he is unemployed too long, or fails to comply with petty restrictions.
Zachariah drifts through a succession of jobs – domestic servant, garage attendant, waiter, road gang laborer – tormented, insulted, and degraded by white employers who summarily dismiss him because of his ignorance or out of malice.
In addition, he falls foul of Marumu, the leader of a gang of “tsotsis”  who are terrorizing the streets of Sophiatown.
Fearful that poverty will drive her son to the street gangs, his wife takes a job as a domestic servant where she must live on premises, separated from her family.
Zachariah is caught sleeping with Vinah during a nightly police raid and is arrested for trespassing.
He returns from prison to find his wife dead, murdered by Murumu because she refused to give in to his sexual demands.
Inexorably Zachariah’s overwhelming helplessness and frustration reveal the social impoverishment of all African men, women, and children.
Starved off the land after confiscation by successive governments, the black man is uprooted from his native soil and forced continually to search for a home and livelihood.
Deprived of political power, he must weave a treacherous path of survival among the myriad written and unwritten laws that govern black contact with the white world – laws which are often contradictory and inevitably result in severe penalties.
The family is increasingly torn apart when both parents must work to buy bread, leaving their children to grow up amid the violence and filth of the streets.
In the end, the African is completely defenseless in his struggle to survive, inhumanely pulled between the capricious brutality of white law and the wanton violence of the black outlaw.

A villager new to the big city – Bhagwaan  – turns to crime to avoid starvation.
He is drawn into the gang of slum crime lord ‘dada’
Shambu  where he falls into every crime but one: violence against women.
When an impoverished but honourable young widow hangs herself after being raped by Shambu Dada, the cries of her orphaned baby awaken Bhagwaan’s soul.
He rebels against his former master.
Bhagwaan vows to atone for his formerly evil life, and adopts the orphaned baby as his own son.
The innocent young boy becomes Bhagwaan’s source of personal redemption and the inspiration for all that he does.
12 years later the man now lovingly hailed as “Bhagwaan Dada” has transformed the former crime-ridden slum into a safe and happy neighbourhood - Shantinagar -
where his adopted son Govinda  has become the pride and joy of the whole community.
Despite his own dark past, this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values.
At this time, Bhagwaan chances to rescue another naïve young man new to the big city –
Swaroop  – when Shambu Dada’s gang steal all Swaroop’s money.
Impressed with Swaroop’s education as well as the similarity of situation to his own arrival in the city years before, Bhagwaan takes the “innocent and simple” villager under his protective wing.
He arranges a good job, even brings Swaroop home to live with himself and his son, young Govinda.
Swaroop and Bhagwaan claim each other as ‘brothers’.
One day on a roadway nearby the district, members of Shambu Dada’s gang assault a beautiful young woman whom Shambu lusts after.
Swaroop hears her cries for help and tries to rescue her, believing as Bhagwaan does that: “It is every man’s duty to honour and protect women.”
But Swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight.
He is badly beaten by Shambu
’s men before Bhagwaan can rescue him in turn.
The young woman  who gives her name as Bijli insists on tending the wounded Swaroop who bravely tried to help her.
Bhagwaan invites Bijli to come live at their house until she can find a place to stay.
After some initial confusion when Govinda mistakes Bijli for his new ‘uncle’ Swaroop’s wife, all four of them – Bhagwaan, Govinda, Swaroop, and now Bijli – live happily in Bhagwaan’s modest home, Govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between Swaroop and Bijli.
However, what neither Bhagwaan nor Swaroop realise is that Bijli is a streetwalker.
Intercepted on her way out to work one evening, Bijli spills Bhagwaan a yarn about how she is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute in order to arrest real prostitutes and their patrons.
Bhagwaan believes her.
He preserves her ‘secret’, and all four continue happily in the house just as before, ignorance being bliss.
The audience soon learn, though, that appearances are deceiving:
Bijli is not, actually, a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein
she bilks potential ‘johns’ of money through clever ruses.
Meanwhile, Shambu Dada has sworn revenge against Bhagwaan for foiling his plan to abduct Bijli.
After brutally beating to death one of his gangmembers who botched the abduction, Shambu dumps the corpse in Bhagwaan’s territory seeking to frame Bhagwaan for the murder.
The honest policeman Inspector Vijay , though, is fully aware of Shambu Dada’s crime empire activities as well as Bhagwaan’s reformation.
When Bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder, Inspector Vijay not only fails to arrest Bhagwaan but even introduces Bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter –
Madhu  – who is researching crime trends in the city, and recommends that she visit Shantinagar.
The street-savvy Bhagwaan helps Inspector Vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture Shambu Dada in possession of the murder weapon.
Shambu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
All seems well.
Bhagwaan invites Madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in Shantinagar.
When young Govinda mischievously invites Bijli to garland his ‘uncle’ Swaroop, we discover that the blushing Swaroop hides a growing attraction to Bijli.
When Madhu reciprocates Bhagwaan’s invitation by inviting him and Swaroop to her birthday party at a fancy hotel, Bijli manages to talk her way along.
After Bijli’s comically jealous behaviour at the party, she confesses how she has come to love Swaroop, just as he loves her.
She tries to explain that no future is possible between them.
But Swaroop, ecstatic at learning his feelings are returned, simply won’t listen.
Unknown to all, however, the evil Shambu Dada has escaped during transfer between prison facilities.
Shambu vows to revenge himself upon Bhagwaan at all costs.
While warning Bhagwaan of his danger at Shambu’s escape, Inspector Vijay happens to mention that Bijli is not, in fact, working for the police at all but has actually been arrested, if released, on suspicion of prostitution.
Bhagwaan angrily confronts Bijli.
Devastated, Bijli humbly confesses she lied about working with the police.
Bhagwaan strikes her and throws her out of the house … and the whole neighbourhood.
When Swaroop returns home he wants to support Bijli
but it is already too late:
Bijli is gone.
All now seems lost for our lovers.
But wait!
A chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals Bijli’s true story: she has nobly sacrificed her reputation in order to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of her sole surviving relative, a little sister, after the rest of their entire family were killed outright during the Bhopal Disaster.
[1984 – cyanide gas cloud]
Abjectly chastened, Bhagwaan and Swaroop comb the city for the missing Bijli, and almost abandon all hope.
Swaroop finally discovers ‘Bijli’ – whole real name is now revealed as Geeta – at the hospital.
The lovers are reconciled.
Bhagwaan begs Geeta to claim him as her brother.
He pledges himself to both pay for the little sister’s operation and see his ‘sister’ Geeta married happily to Swaroop at the earliest opportunity.
Swaroop’s mother comes to welcome Geeta and bless Bhagwaan and Govinda – who is jubilant that his ‘matchmaking’ efforts succeeded – for their role in getting her son married.
Geeta’s
little sister’s operation is successful, so she also joins the household.
The whole of Shantinagar eagerly helps with preparations for the upcoming wedding.
Madhu, who is herself becoming romantically interested with Bhagwaan, comes to Shantinagar on the day before the big event “to help with wedding work.”
Govinda persuades Madhu to help him distribute the last of the wedding cards throughout the community.
Hours later Bhagwaan becomes alarmed to discover that neither Govinda nor Madhu has come back.
Some distance beyond the end of the city Bhagwaan comes across an exhausted and terrified Madhu, who explains how both she and Govinda had been kidnapped by the gang of the fugitive Shambu Dada and taken to a ruined fort hidden in the wilderness.
Shambu intended to rape her, but brave young Govinda had attacked Shambu so that she could escape, asking her to “Bring Father” for help.
Deeper in the wilderness
Bhagwaan finally finds little Govinda, who has been horribly mutilated and left to die.
Govinda explains in a failing voice how he succeeded in overcoming Shambu’s gang with the fighting skills his father taught him, but was unable to defeat Shambu himself.
Shambu then vented his rage, at being cheated of Madhu, by brutally crushing Govinda
’s legs – “There were nails in his shoes, Father ...” – leaving the boy paralysed and bleeding to death.
After receiving final blessing, Govinda dies in his father’s arms ... having sacrificed his own all-too-short life to save the life of another.
As darkness falls in the wilderness, Bhagwaan tenderly burns his son’s remains.
Bhagwaan solemnly vows to be avenged upon Shambu, and binds Madhu to silence regarding Govinda
’s murder lest the wedding be interrupted.
The wedding of Geeta and Swaroop goes forward, attended by the whole of Shantinagar.
But part way through the ceremonies someone discovers that they’re missing the sindoor  needed to fill the bride’s hair parting for the ritual.
Bhagwaan rushes off to buy the essential sindoor.
Shambu confronts Bhagwaan in the marketplace.
They fight bitterly, until Bhagwaan at last overwhelms Shambu.
Remembering poor Govinda
last words
, Bhagwaan dons one of Shambu’s horrible nail-studded boots and uses it to finish off Shambu.
Or so he thinks.
At the very last, the dying Shambu manages to hurl a hidden knife that pierces Bhagwaan’s chest.
Knowing himself to be mortally wounded, Bhagwaan returns to the wedding just at the point where the ceremony requires him, as the bride’s brother, to bless the newly wedded couple – which he does, using a smear of his own red blood instead of the hard-won sindoor.
Geeta and Swaroop now realise he is injured and dying, also that Govinda, too, is missing.
Bhagwaan responds that he is “on his way to join Govinda” ... and dies in their arms in his turn.
Swaroop and Geeta pledge to continue Bhagwaan’s legacy at Shantinagar.

Like in many other Monicelli movies, the main theme of Amici miei is friendship, seen from a rather bitter point of view.
It tells the story of four middle-aged friends in Florence who organize together idle pranks  in a continuous attempt to prolong childhood during their adult life.  
Count Mascetti  is an impoverished noble who has no means to support his family, but does not renounce high living pleasures anyway, and has an underage mistress, Titti .

Melandri  is a communal architect whose main goal is to find the ideal woman.
Necchi  is the owner of a café and pool hall where the friends usually plan their zingarate.
During the movie they are joined by a renowned, military-like surgeon, Sassaroli , in whose clinic they recover after being hospitalized, injured after a mismanaged zingarata.
Melandri falls in love with Sassaroli's wife, exclaiming
"I've seen the Madonna!", only to discover she has psychological problems.
The plot is mostly composed of elaborate practical jokes organized by the friends, including the creation of a fake mafia mob in whose "criminal acts" they involve a pensioner, Righi , who used to snatch croissants from the cake tray in Necchi's café, and Mascetti's attempts to save his marriage despite his relationship with Titti.
The film ends with Perozzi's death, which still does not deprive the friends of their desecrating hijinks, not even in face of their own mortality; perozzi himself makes a last joke to the priest.
When Perozzi's wife, criticized by Melandri for her lack of tears, comments: "One can weep if somebody dies.
But here nobody has died", Mascetti replies: "Well, in reality he had never been so much, but I liked him."
During the funeral procession they "homage" their dead friend by telling the wide-eyed Righi that Perozzi was killed for being a traitor to the mafia.

In the summer of 208, during the Han Dynasty, the imperial army led by chancellor Cao Cao embarks on a campaign to eliminate the southern warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei in the name of eradicating rebels, with the reluctant approval of Emperor Xian.
Cao Cao's mighty army swiftly conquers Jing Province and the Battle of Changban is ignited when Cao's cavalry starts attacking civilians on an exodus led by Liu Bei.
During the battle, Liu Bei's followers, including his sworn brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, give an excellent display of their combat skills by holding off the enemy while buying time for the civilians to retreat.
The warrior Zhao Yun fights bravely to rescue Liu Bei's entrapped family but only succeeds in rescuing Liu's infant son.
Following the battle, Liu Bei's advisor Zhuge Liang embarks on a diplomatic mission to Jiangdong to form an alliance between his lord and Sun Quan to deal with Cao Cao's invasion.
Sun Quan was initially in the midst of a dilemma of whether to surrender or resist, but his decision to resist Cao Cao hardens after Zhuge Liang's clever persuasion and a subsequent tiger hunt with his viceroy Zhou Yu and sister Sun Shangxiang.
Meanwhile, naval commanders Cai Mao and Zhang Yun from Jing Province pledge allegiance to Cao Cao and are received warmly by Cao, who places them in command of his navy.
After the hasty formation of the alliance, the forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan call for a meeting to formulate a plan to counter Cao Cao's army, which is rapidly advancing towards Red Cliff from both land and water.
The battle begins with Sun Shangxiang leading a light cavalry unit to lure Cao Cao's vanguard force into the allies' Bagua Formation.
The vanguard force is defeated by the allies but Cao Cao shows no disappointment and proceeds to lead his main army to the riverbank directly opposite the allies' main camp, where they make camp.
While the allies throw a banquet to celebrate their victory, Zhuge Liang thinks of a plan to send Sun Shangxiang to infiltrate Cao Cao's camp and conduct an espionage mission.
The duo maintain contact by sending messages via a pigeon.
The film ends with Zhou Yu lighting his miniaturised battleships on a map based on the battle formation.  
Sun Shangxiang has infiltrated Cao Cao's camp and is secretly noting details and sending them via a pigeon to Zhuge Liang.
Meanwhile, Cao Cao's army is seized with a plague of typhoid fever that kills a number of his troops.
Cao Cao orders the corpses to be sent on floating rafts to the allies' camp, hoping to pass the plague on to his enemies.
The allied army's morale is affected when some unsuspecting soldiers let the plague in, and eventually a disheartened Liu Bei leaves with his forces while Zhuge Liang stays behind to assist Sun Quan's forces.
Cao Cao is overjoyed when he hears that the alliance had collapsed.
At the same time, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun propose a new tactic of interlocking the battleships together with iron beams to minimize rocking when sailing on the river and reduce the chances of the troops falling seasick.
[[Image:
Red Cliff.jpg|right|thumb|Sun Quan's forces look on as Liu Bei leaves the alliance.
From right to left:
Zhou Yu , Sun Quan , Lu Su (Hou Yong .
Subsequently, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang make plans on how to eliminate Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, and produce 100,000 arrows respectively.
They agreed that whoever fails to complete his mission will be punished by execution under military law.
Zhuge Liang's ingenious strategy of letting the enemy shoot 20 boats covered in straw brings in over 100,000 arrows from the enemy and makes Cao Cao doubt the loyalty of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun.
On the other hand, Cao Cao sends Jiang Gan to persuade Zhou Yu to surrender, but Zhou tricks Jiang instead into believing that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are planning to assassinate Cao.
Both Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu's respective plans complement each other when Cao Cao is convinced, despite earlier having doubts about Jiang Gan's report, that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were indeed planning to assassinate him by deliberately "donating" arrows to the enemy.
Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are executed and Cao Cao realises his folly afterwards
but it is too late.
In Sun Quan's camp, Sun Shangxiang returns from Cao Cao's camp with a map of the enemy formation.
Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang decide to attack Cao Cao's navy with fire anticipating that a special climatic condition will soon cause the wind to shift and that the resulting southeast wind will blow to their advantage.
Before the battle, Sun Quan's forces have a final moment together, feasting on rice dumplings to celebrate the Winter Solstice.
Meanwhile, Zhou Yu's wife, Xiaoqiao, heads towards Cao Cao's camp alone secretly, hoping to persuade Cao to give up his ambitious plans, but fails and decides to distract him instead to buy time for her side.
The battle begins when the southeast wind starts blowing in the middle of the night and Sun Quan's forces launch their attack on Cao Cao's navy.
On the other hand, Liu Bei's forces, which had apparently left the alliance, start attacking Cao Cao's forts on land.
By dawn, Cao Cao's entire navy has been destroyed.
The allies launch another offensive on Cao Cao's ground army, stationed in his forts, and succeed in breaking through using testudo formation despite suffering heavy casualties.
Although Cao Cao is besieged in his main camp, he manages to hold Zhou Yu hostage after catching him off guard together with Cao Hong.
Xiahou Jun also appears, holding Xiaoqiao hostage and causing the allies to hesitate.
Just then, Zhao Yun manages to reverse the situation by rescuing Xiaoqiao with a surprise attack and put Cao Cao at the mercy of the allies instead.
Eventually, the allies decide to spare Cao Cao's life and tell him never to return before leaving for home.
In the final scene, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang are seen having a conversation before Zhuge walks away into the far distance with the newborn foal Mengmeng.  
The Western release trimmed the length of the film from 280 minutes to 148 minutes and was released in some regions under the title Battle of Red Cliff.
An opening narration in English is provided to set the historical context whereas in the Asian release, a more brief description of the context of the political situation appears in scrolling form 10 minutes into the film.
Notable cuts include the background and motivations behind Zhuge Liang's plan to obtain 100,000 arrows, including the threat to his life, and the early parts of Sun Shangxiang's infiltration.

In the desert wilderness of 1930s Manchuria, The Bad  - a bandit and hitman - is hired to acquire a treasure map from a Japanese official traveling by train.
Before he can get it however, The Weird  - a thief  - steals the map and is caught up in The Bad's derailment of the train.
This involves the slaughter of the Japanese and Manchurian guards, and various civilians.
The Good  - an eagle-eyed bounty hunter - appears on the scene to claim the bounty on The Bad.
Meanwhile The Weird escapes, eluding his Good and Bad pursuers.
A third force - a group of Manchurian bandits - also want the map to sell to the Ghost Market.
The Weird hopes to uncover the map's secrets and recover what he believes is gold and riches buried by the Qing Dynasty just before the collapse of their government.
As the story continues, an escalating battle for the map occurs, with bounties placed on heads and the Imperial Japanese Army racing to reclaim its map as it can apparently "save the Japanese Empire".
After a series of graphic shoot-outs and chases, a final battle erupts in which the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, The Good, The Bad and his gang are chasing The Weird all at once.
The Japanese army kills most of the bandits.
The Good kills many Japanese soldiers and sets off an explosion that drives them away.
The Bad's gang is slowly killed off and he kills those that attempt to leave the chase.
Only the Bad, the Weird and the Good make it to the "treasure".
However, they find that it is nothing more than a boarded-over hole in the desert.
The Bad recognizes The Weird as the "Finger Chopper" - a criminal that cut off his finger in a knife fight five years ago - and the man that the Good had thought the Bad to be.
Turning on each other in a final act of vengeance for the slights they suffered, they finally gun each other down after a prolonged Mexican standoff.
The three lay in the sand, dying and alone, as the "useless hole" they had fought and died for suddenly and belatedly erupts with a geyser of crude oil.
The Good does survive along with the Weird.
With a newly raised bounty on the Weird, a new chase begins as he flees across the Manchurian desert.
Anna Khitrova , a British-Russian midwife at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth.
She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon , an old vor in the Russian Mafia.
Anna thus sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, having meetings with Semyon who she initially regards as friendly.
Anna's mother Helen  does not discourage her, but Anna's Ukrainian uncle and self-described former KGB officer, Stepan , whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary, urges caution.
Through translation of the diary, Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his unstable son Kirill , had abused the girl, addicted her to heroin, forced her into prostitution and raped her.
Ultimately Anna realises that the baby was fathered by Semyon.

Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary.

Semyon distrusts Anna's uncle Stepan due to his former position and ethnicity, ordering a hit on him.
Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing.
As Nikolai's star rises within the vory, an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member, with the appropriate tattoos, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's incompetent son who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a kurdish associate, Azim.
The hit was not approved by Semyon and was ill-advised; the Chechen gang are now coming to London to seek vengeance having killed Azim's nephew.
Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill's place during a meeting at the baths with Azim.
The Chechens attack, thinking Nikolai is Kirill, but Nikolai kills them both and ends up in hospital with severe wounds as a result.
It is then revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang, working under license by the British Government and a Senior Officer .
As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Tatiana's diary before Semyon had it destroyed and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape, with a paternity test of the Tatiana's baby as evidence.
Stepan is also safe, hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection.
Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her
but as Kirill sits by the Thames, almost unable to throw the little girl into the river, Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back.
Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses.
Nikolai and Anna then kiss as they part for the last time.

It emerges that Lady Port-Huntley, who has no legs, was once Chester's lover; and saying that "of all the people in the world, you know the least about grief", she orders him to try to make her cry by retelling how she lost her legs.
It emerges that his dad Fyodor Kent  was also in love with her.
After she left him, Fyodor became an alcoholic.
One day as they were driving as Helen performs oral sex on Chester, they crashed into Fyodor's car, and Helen's left leg was trapped in the wreckage.
A drunken Fyodor, determined to save and marry his beloved, amputated her leg but removed the wrong one accidentally.
In the present, Lady Port-Huntley tells Chester he can try, but she doesn't think he'll succeed.
Fyodor also shows up and enters the contest to represent Canada.
Musicians are streaming into Winnipeg, including Roderick Kent , representing Serbia.
Roderick is swathed in mourning and hypochondria, because his young son died and his wife is missing.
As soon as he arrives, he and Chester begin grating on each other.
A sober Fyodor also reveals that he has been making prosthetic legs for Helen to atone for his tragic mistake.
She's allergic to wood and leather, so he uses glass ones, and fills them with her brand of beer.
The contest begins, with various countries pitted against each other.
Fyodor's melodramatic piano ballad is soon defeated, but Chester's glitzy "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" act wins over the audience.
Unfortunately Roderick sees Narcissa singing from a swinging seat, and collapses in horror realizing it's his wife singing.
Roderick manages to do his act, and defeats everyone with his heartbreaking cello music.
After, Roderick gives his father's glass legs to Lady Port-Huntley, who is able to walk for the first time in years.
Overjoyed, she reunites with Chester, but when Fyodor begs her for forgiveness, she refuses to give it.
Shattered, Fyodor returns to drinking, falls through the glass ceiling of the contest arena into a pool of beer, and dies.
Meanwhile, Roderick has reunited with his wife; since Narcissa doesn't remember him or their son, however, she simply regards him as a one-night stand, and sings a tragic love song as if it were a showtune.
Roderick accidentally drops a jar containing his dead son's heart, and it shatters.
Roderick becomes determined to defeat his brother, and plays his most plaintive music ever, while Chester manipulates the audience with his showtunes, often buying out other countries he's defeated in the contest to "join America" in his performance.
Soon the brothers are the only ones left in the competition, and Lady Port-Huntley &mdash; with her glass legs &mdash; is part of Chester's final act.
But a few jagged notes from Roderick's cello are enough to spring leaks in the glass, and the legs collapse.
Horrified and humiliated, she orders her gigolo to carry her back to her office.
Roderick plays his most tragic piece, and Narcissa sings sadly to it as her memories return.
Chester goes to comfort Helen, but she stabs him with a giant piece of glass from her shattered legs.
The bleeding Chester staggers out smoking a cigar, dropping a match in a puddle of spilled beer.
Soon the entire building goes up in flames.
Teddy rescues Helen, and Roderick and Narcissa escape.
Chester staggers to a piano and plays Narcissa's ballad &mdash; the saddest music in the world &mdash; as he burns in the fire.
Reportedly, the film is about slum kids who are trained for a dance competition.

The film is similar in some ways to Seth Michael Donsky's 1996 film Twisted made prior to Tierney's film.
Like in Donsky's film, the plot of Oliver Twist is updated to the present day, and moved out of the London poor house onto the streets of Toronto.
In addition, the tale is told not from Oliver's point of view, but rather that of Dodge .
The prosaically beautiful Oliver  falls into the hands of down-and-out young men.
Dodge takes Oliver under his wing and instructs him in the unforgiving arts of drug abuse and prostitution.
Oliver develops a crush on Dodge and views him as his boyfriend, complicating their friendship.
Dodge does not reciprocate his feelings, and reacts angrily to Oliver's kisses and other signs of affection.
As Oliver's innocence dissolves, both young men confront their demons and ultimately it is Dodge who finds he cannot escape his past.
Dodge is found by his abusive brother around the same time the young mens care taker commits suicide, sending Dodge into a violent rage at the films conclusion.
In 1917, former newspaperman William Gordon  enlists in the U.S. Army.
The day before he is to leave Washington, D.C. for the fighting in Europe, he meets socialite Joel Carter .
The couple spend the day together.
He tells her that, because he once wrote a book on cryptography under a pen name, the army is searching for him to put him to work behind a desk, but he is eager to fight the Germans.
The next day, just before he boards his train, Lieutenant Gordon is ordered to report to John Carter , the Assistant Secretary of War.
He reassigns the unhappy Gordon to Major William Brennan  to spend the war decoding German transmissions.
He learns that Joel had revealed his secret to her uncle, John Carter, in order to keep him around.
The U.S. is preparing to send its army across the Atlantic Ocean, but there are grave worries about the U-boat threat.
Brennan comes up with the idea to have British escorts meet American transports before they enter the most dangerous zone.
For maximum security, the rendezvous point is to be transmitted in code to the ships the day before.
An ammunition ship is sent first to test the new system.
Unbeknownst to the Americans, a German spy ring in the city has already cracked their code and deliberately allowed the ship through in order to lure more valuable troop transports into their trap.
However, when Gordon manages to decipher one of their messages, he realizes the truth and alerts his superiors.
Brennan suspects his supposedly unbreakable code was stolen by his mistress, Olivia Karloff , and sets a trap.
He catches her red-handed, but foolishly he is alone, and she shoots him dead.
To her dismay, she is ordered to sacrifice herself to divert suspicion from the spy ring.
When she attends Brennan's funeral, Gordon has her brought in for questioning.
Carter sees her enter Gordon's office and becomes very jealous.
Gordon lets Karloff go free so that she might lead him to the rest of the spies.
The Germans decide to betray one of their own men, Captain Nicholas Nieterstein , in order to reassure the Americans and get them to resume operations.
When he is arrested at the Russian Embassy, Nieterstein apologizes to Ambassador Gregory  for giving his loyalty to his mother's country before flinging himself through a window to his death.
Afterward, Gordon escorts a shaken Karloff back to her hotel, where he discovers her guilt.
However, since the hotel is staffed by German agents, he is the one who is captured.
He refuses to divulge the new American code until they show him that Carter is also a prisoner; she had followed the pair to the hotel.
He then gives in and provides the coordinates of the new rendezvous point.
When the Germans transmit the information, it is decoded by the Americans.
The latitude and longitude that Gordon had given are actually the address of the hotel.
Gordon and Carter  are rescued.
They get married.
Betty is startled awake in her bed on a stormy night.
She searches for the cause of the shock while she sings the song.
Then, unexplainable phenomena start happening in the house.
Mysterious Mose  appears, and sings part of the song.
Bizarre cartoon creatures appear and, at first, sing and enhance Mose's "mysterious" image.
Quickly, however, the antics become frightful even to Mose.
The film escalates into chaos, which ends when Mose bursts, revealing him having been a construction  the whole time.
Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose is a short film made in 1998 by film makers Seamus Walsh and Mark Caballero of Screen Novelties.
The film utilizes puppetry, stop motion and silhouette animation to tell the story of an otherworldly creature preparing a celebration in a cemetery.
Walsh and Caballero used the song Mysterious Mose recorded in 1930 by Harry Reser and his Radio All-star Novelty Orchestra.
The film has gained world wide attention in film festivals and has retained a small cult audience.

{{Plot}} Husband and wife
Rawdon  and Miranda  are soulmates.
Their love for each other is palpable as they lie in bed treasuring their 6 month old daughter Quincey.
Miranda fantasizes about the speech she plans to make when, one day in their future, she will give this tiny infant away at her wedding.
Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life.
Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey.
Staying as strong as he can
he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel.
It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel.
Rawdon continues to see visions of her.
Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness; when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents  and Uncle Jack  – firmly in Quincey's life.
Rawdon explains these visions to his therapist Paula  as she helps him with the long grieving process and over a period of years, with Quincey growing before our eyes, Rawdon tries to move on with his life.
He tries to date other women.
Disastrously.
He falls instantly in love with Sam  
who ends up becoming his good friend and a surrogate Aunt to Quincey.
He dates other including Kimberly  who Quincey wisely suggests is far better suited to her Uncle Jack.
And she is right.
When Jack and Kimberly get married, Rawdon is their best man.
All the while Miranda's metaphysical presence is with him.
He goes from needing her, to blaming her, being angry at her.
But for a long, long time he won't let her go away.
Part of him wants her to stay alive in his imagination forever and gradually this presence that helped him initially eventually becomes an impediment to his moving on in life.
In contrast to her Dad's stagnation, Quincey is growing up fast , and in no time she is dating, stealing cars, trying to set her Dad up with her best friend's divorced Moms, going off to University and falling in love with a Frenchman named Philippe.
It is not until Rawdon finally plucks up the courage to ask out somebody who might just be right for him that he finally, tearfully, asks Miranda to leave him.
This is ultimately a coming of age story.
We watch Quincey literally come of age whilst her father, emotionally, comes of age.
He eventually gives up the now stultifying memory of his dead wife and arrives at a new beginning.
The end of this story is also the beginning of another where Rawdon, surrounded by the people he loves—but without Miranda—finds himself giving Quincey away at her wedding to Philippe.
And here he makes the speech that Miranda made in bed with him and Quincey so many years before.

Introduction:
The usual chase starts for a few seconds until it stops for the  Latin names: Ultra-sonicus Ad Infinitum and Nemesis Ridiculii, plus a "bonus" name for the Road Runner's beep: Beepius-beepius.
The chase then moves around mountain corners until it ends on a mountainside, with the Road Runner ducking behind a corner and leaving a cloud of dust for the coyote to run into.
Wile E. rides the dust cloud all the way through the air, and finally stops to determine where he is, a question mark appearing over his head.
He opens a "door" in the cloud only to see that he is in midair, and sheepishly closes the door as the cloud disperses, and then changes his question mark of surprise to an exclamation point before the inexorable pull of gravity takes effect.
1.
The pair pull up onto opposite outcroppings, and Wile E. attempts to pole-vault from his to his opponent's, but this causes the end of his outcropping to crumble and the coyote to fall down.
Seeing his impending humiliation approaching, Wile E. attempts to make the best of it by climbing up the pole; however, he keeps falling back to the bottom of it.
Eventually, the pole turns around so fast that it whirs like a propeller, and then grinds against a cliffside all the way down to the part Wile E. is holding.
When it finally stops rotating, the coyote then pulls himself onto the narrow bar left of the pole and accepts his fate.
2.
In a gag that sees four attempts in this cartoon, Wile E. sits on a rocket and lights the fuse, aiming towards the Road Runner on the opposite site of the chasm.  
The first attempt fails when the fuel and nosecone launch out of the rocket, leaving Wile E. sitting on an empty hull.
The hull crunches down, and then Wile falls, annoyed, to the canyon floor.
3.
As the Road Runner burns rubber on the ground roads, Wile E. is pulling back on a falling safe attached to a rope and pulley.
Eventually, however, the weight overcomes him and the coyote is pulled through the pulley, removing all of his chest fur, and then down onto a see-saw as the safe lands next to him.
Wile then slides off the rock face to fall into the canyon a fourth time, and is then smashed by the safe, leaving the coyote's torso thin and flat.
4.
The second attempt at the rocket is foiled when the rocket falls out of its aim towards the Road Runner and points directly downwards before it fires, leading to an extra-speedy fifth fall.
5.
Now, Ross animates a sequence in which Wile E. sticks a firecracker into the center hole of a Frisbee  and throws it at his nemesis, but before he releases the disc, the firecracker drops out of the hole and sizzles at Wile E's foot.
The coyote doesn't notice until he puts his foot down on the firework and instinctively pulls it away just before it explodes, leaving him dazed but apparently unhurt.
Wile then walks away like Charlie Chaplin, revealing behind him that his tail is on fire, unknown to him until he passes the horizon and he yelps in pain!
6.
On his third attempt with the rocket, he lights the fuse
but it burns quickly and fires successfully out from under him before he could get ready and leaves Wile
floating in midair with a cloud of dust
blocking his view below.
Unable to see what is below him, Wile pokes his foot through the cloud and consequently suffers gravity for the sixth time, as he holds up a sign stating "GOODBYE" and then flipping to "AGAIN".  
7.
To get the bird to stick, Wile leaves out a sheet of ACME Giant Fly Paper in the road and sits down on a rock, laughing at his "genius".
He hears a braking noise, assumes the Road Runner has been caught, and leaps out to catch him, but instead of the Road Runner, he has caught an actual giant fly.
The fly is very unhappy about being stuck on the paper and thus wraps the coyote with it, who tiptoes away from the scene.
8.
On his final attempt at the skyrocket, Wile E. accidentally ignites his tail instead of the fuse, and detects his mistake and leaps up in pain only to smash his head on another outcropping.
Fortunately, this causes him to return to the rocket and to light the fuse with his tail, and after it takes off is struggling briefly to get control then puts out the fire on his tail.
Unfortunately, the rocket is off target, and it bores through the cliff under the Road Runner, who allows the coyote to be humiliated privately.
The rocket finally explodes, blackening the coyote and throwing him back into the air.
Displeased, Wile E. holds up a yellow sign asking "HOW DID I EVER GET INTO
THIS LINE OF WORK?
before falling for a seventh time.
9.
A new plan is formulated, where Wile E. attempts to blow up the Road Runner by pelting explosive tennis balls at him.
The first ball seamlessly blows up a cactus with no issues , and the coyote is eager to try them at work.
As luck would have it, the Road Runner is heard, and Wile is quick to lob another ball at him, but just misses, and the ball then drops onto the arm of a cactus, which throws it directly back to its owner.
A little agitated, the coyote returns the ball, and this time it is caught by power lines and slung back out of Wile E.'s reach.
The ball pops directly back into its original slot in the box of balls as Wile E. arrives on the scene and takes stock.
Sensing the coming explosions, Wile E. holds up a pair of signs: "For Sale One used Tennis Racket" and "CHEAP!"
before  a "GIGANTIC EXPLOSION!"
occurs.
10.
The whole cartoon, however, is best known for its ending gag.
Wile E. Coyote is chasing the Road Runner through a series of pipelines, which causes both of them to emerge in a greatly shrunken state.
Upon discovering their situation, they agree to re-enter the pipeline and be transformed back into full size.
The Road Runner emerges at normal size, but Wile is still in small size when he comes out.
Upon discovering this turn of fortune, the Road Runner stops and allows his rival to "catch" him.
The coyote doesn't notice anything until he steps over his opponent's feet and rushes back
to finally "catch" the Road Runner.
The coyote is ecstatic and pulls out his knife and fork to eat his opponent...until he stares more closely at the bird's huge legs, which are twice as tall as he is, and looks up to see he is massively outgunned.
The Road Runner gives an amplified "beep-beep", causing Wile to drop his utensils in shock.
He can only hold up signs to the audience stating, "Okay, wise guys, you always wanted me to catch him -" and "Now what do I do?".
Well, That's all Folks!
 On the island of Amity, sheriff Martin Brody, the hero of previous shark attacks, has died from a heart attack.
His wife, Ellen Brody , thinks it was from fear of the shark.
She now lives with their son Sean  and his fiancee Tiffany .
Sean works as a police deputy and is sent to clear a log from a buoy a few days before Christmas.

Ellen becomes so obsessive that she starts having nightmares of being attacked by a shark.
Then she starts getting psychic feelings when the shark attacks Michael.

During Carla Brody's speech about her sculpture ... the shark suddenly attacks, kills Margaret's mother and scares Thea.
Ellen Brody is horrified by the event and, to end the farce, goes on Jake's boat.
She intends to sacrifice herself to stop the killing.
Michael soon returns home and lets the truth slip about the shark, which doesn't turn out well.
Michael and Jake are eventually flown by Hoagie to look for Ellen and they find her and the shark in pursuit of her boat.
Hoagie lands the plane on the water, ordering Michael and Jake swim to the boat as the shark drags the plane and Hoagie underwater.
Michael was upset with Ellen for putting herself in danger, and Ellen apologized for worrying him.
Much to Ellen Brody's disbelief, Hoagie survives.
Jake and Michael hastily put together an explosive powered by electrical impulses.
Michael and Jake go back up on deck and begin blasting the shark with the impulses, which begin to drive the shark mad.
As Jake moves to the front of the boat, the shark is absent until it unexpectedly lunges out from the water, giving it the chance to pull Jake under and maul him, although he manages to get the explosive into the shark's mouth before he is dragged under and attacked.
Michael continues to blast the shark with the impulses, causing it to rise out of the water again, igniting the bomb right as Ellen thrusts the broken bowsprit into its stomach.
The shark explodes upon impact and the front of the ship sinks to the bottom of the sea with the creature's corpse.
Michael then hears Jake, severely injured but alive, floating in the water, and the four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land.
The film concludes as Hoagie flies Ellen back to Amity Island.

Staff Sgt.
Raphael "Jinji" Moked is ordered by his captain, company commander Shamgar, to retrieve Sergio Constanza, a deserter from reserve service.
On his way he meets his girlfriend Yaeli and offers to talk to her father, Victor Hasson, to get a blessing for their relationship.
Hasson gives his blessing, believing that Moked came for his older daughter Shifra, but throws him out of the house after finding out this was not so.
Yaeli does not wish to part from Moked, and sneaks into a suitcase in his jeep.
Meanwhile, Sergio Constanza tricks several other gamblers into losing thousands of dollars, which he intends to use to repay his debt to Mr. Hasson.
The gamblers find out about the plot however, which leaves Sergio with no choice but to run away to the army with Moked.
Moked and Constanza make it to the Sinai base, and Mr. Hasson follows them posing as Constanza.
When he is not allowed into the base, he steals a loader to break in.
Meanwhile, Moked finds out that Yaeli came with them, and Constanza comes up with a plot to make her an authorized visitor, by claiming that she is a singer/entertainer sent from the Education Corps.

Hasson goes fishing, but then accidentally goes over the border and encounters an Egyptian patrol, which takes him captive.
The Israeli soldiers devise a plot to rescue him by posing as UN observers.
While the plot doesn't go as planned, Hasson is eventually rescued and returned to the base.
When Hasson returns to the base, he discovers that the plot of land that Sergio sold him isn't really an oil field.
However, an inasane Shamgar appears and falls into the hole dug there by Hasson, making oil come out.
The film ends with Hasson, Moked and Constanza trying to sell the oil in Tel Aviv early in the morning.
Rachel , a high school girl, seems to have the life that most people envy: she has a steady boyfriend, great friends, and a place on the school's soccer team.
Preparing for college and separating from her boyfriend are the main worries of this teen, as she lives a carefree life like most girls her age.
However, Rachel's world falls apart the day she discovers that Jason , the guy whom she lost her virginity to at a party and died in a car accident a few months ago, was HIV positive and an heavy IV drug user.
Rachel immediately goes to an AIDS clinic to get a rapid swab test, which comes back positive.
Devastated by the fact that she may actually be infected with the virus, Rachel then confides in her substitute teacher, Sarah , who has secretly been living with the disease for years.
But both young women are about to find out their secrets will not be kept secret for very long, as word begins to spread throughout their high school and rumors fly, making some of these students realize that they may not be as "invincible" as they think they are.
A Mexican widow  receives a letter from the high school attended by her son .
It informs her that the boy is about to fail his geometry exams for the third time.
The woman berates her son, then turns on the television, refusing to speak to him.
The boy leaves the room, vowing that he will never fail geometry again.
The boy resorts to using black magic in order to pass the exam.
In a dark room, he reads from a tome of sorcery, which states, "
As a protection for the invocation of a major demon, place yourself inside a pentagon drawn with your own blood.
This pentagon will be your only protection.
" The boy proceeds to follow these instructions.
While the woman sits in the living room, watching a pastiche of The Exorcist, she hears her son screaming from the next room.
When she enters, she finds him standing in the middle of the bloody seal.
He shouts a warning, telling her that the pentagon is his only protection.
A glowing portal opens in the wall, and a demon  steps through.
The boy asks the demon to grant two wishes.
The first is that he will not fail geometry again.
The second is the return of his father, Francisco, who died in an accident three months ago.
The demon complies with the latter, causing Francisco to materialise immediately.
However, he is now a mindless zombie.
Francisco kills and eats his wife, while their son looks on in horror, unable to step out of the pentagon for fear of losing its magical protection.
The demon commands the boy to surrender, but he refuses to give in, saying that he cannot be harmed while he stands within the pentagon.
The demon reasons that he has already granted one of the boy's two wishes: his family is together again.
He also points out that what the boy has drawn is not a pentagon, but a hexagon, which offers no magical protection whatsoever.
The demon muses that the boy's other wish has also been granted: he will never fail geometry again.
Francisco approaches his son from behind and takes hold of his head, tilting it backwards.
The boy laments the unfairness of his situation.
The demon agrees, and reaches out a hand to take hold of his throat.
The screen fades to black as ripping sounds are heard.

In the Land of the Deaf.
Warren Schmidt is retiring from his position as an actuary with Woodmen of the World, an insurance company in Omaha, Nebraska.
Schmidt is given a retirement dinner that seems to bring no comfort.
Schmidt finds it hard to adjust to his new life outside of work, feeling useless.
One evening, he sees a television advertisement about a foster program for African children, Plan USA, and decides to sponsor a child.
He soon receives an information package with a photo of his foster child, a small Tanzanian boy named Ndugu Umbo, to whom he relates his life in a series of candid, rambling letters.
Schmidt visits his young successor to offer his help, but the offer is politely declined.
As he leaves the building, Schmidt sees the contents and files of his office, the sum of his entire career, set out for garbage collectors.
He describes to Ndugu his longtime alienation from Helen, his wife, who suddenly dies from a blood clot in her brain just after his retirement and their purchase of a Winnebago Adventurer motor home.
Friends arrive, along with Jeannie, his only daughter, and her fiancé Randall Hertzel from Denver.
They console him at the funeral, but Jeannie later berates him for taking his wife for granted, such as by refusing to fully pay for the Winnebago  and burying her in a cheap casket.
He asks her to move back for a while to take care of him, but she refuses.
Meanwhile, Randall tries to entice him into a pyramid scheme.
Schmidt feels that Randall, a waterbed salesman, is unsuited to his daughter, who he feels could do better.
After the couple leaves, Schmidt is overcome by loneliness.
He stops showering, sleeps in front of the television, and goes shopping with a coat over pajamas to load up on frozen foods.
In his wife's closet he discovers some hidden love letters disclosing her long-ago affair with a mutual friend.
Schmidt angrily confronts the friend, cursing the betrayal.
In order to find some control in his life, he decides to take a journey alone in his new Winnebago to see his daughter and convince her not to marry Randall.
He tells Jeannie he's headed out early to the wedding, but she makes it clear she doesn't want him there until right before the ceremony.
Schmidt visits places from his past, including his hometown and college campus.
His childhood home has been replaced by a tire shop.
While at a trailer campground, he is a dinner guest of a friendly and sympathetic couple.
Schmidt makes at pass at the wife, and flees in terror when she adamantly rejects his advance.
Schmidt later forgives the late Helen for the affair and apologizes to her for his own failings as a husband.
Feeling full of purpose after forgiving his wife, Schmidt arrives in Denver with the intent of stopping Jeannie's wedding.
He stays at the home of Roberta, Randall's mother.
He meets Randall's socially odd, off-putting family and tries unsuccessfully to dissuade Jeannie from the marriage.
Schmidt throws out his back after sleeping on Randall's waterbed, infuriating Jeannie.
Schmidt later flees to his Winnebago after Roberta makes a pass at him in a hot tub.
The next day, Schmidt, under the influence of oxycodone, attends the wedding and delivers a kind speech at the dinner, hiding his disapproval.
Before leaving Denver, Schmidt composes a letter to Ndugu.
Schmidt questions what he has accomplished in life, lamented that he will soon be dead, that his life has made no difference to anyone, and that eventually it will be as if he has never existed at all.
A pile of mail is waiting for him at home.
Schmidt opens a letter from Tanzania.
It is from a nun, who writes that Ndugu is illiterate but appreciates Schmidt's letters and financial support very much.
A painting drawn by Ndugu is enclosed, showing two smiling stick figures, one large and one small, holding hands on a sunny day.
The film ends with Schmidt weeping as he looks at it.

The film follows the Bandini family as they struggle through hard times in 1920s Colorado.
Unemployed and broke, Svevo Bandini  tries to come up with the money his family needs to make it through the winter, while putting up with his difficult mother-in-law , his nervous wife , and his two young boys.
Ambitious, idealistic Stephen Chase  goes to work for the Atlantis Oil Company and is sent to a remote outpost in rural China run by "No. 1 Boss" .
After a while, he feels secure enough to send for his fiancée and goes to Yokohama to meet and marry her.
However, when he gets there, all that is waiting for him is a telegram, in which she explains she is unwilling to live in such a backward country.
He strikes up a conversation with Hester Adams .
She had come to see China for the first time with her father, a professor of Oriental studies, only to have him die on the voyage.
As they become better acquainted, Stephen comes up with an idea (partly to save himself from losing [[Face .
He asks Hester to marry him, explaining that it would be a partnership.
She is impressed by his dream of modernizing China and accepts.
It does not take long however for them to fall in love.
No matter what happens, nothing shakes Stephen's faith in the company.
When his friend, No. 1 Boss, is callously transferred to a lesser position, the old man commits suicide rather than accept the insult.
The new boss, J.T. McCarger , orders Stephen to man an even more isolated post near Siberia.
Stephen is reluctant to go since Hester is pregnant with their first child, but has no choice.
Once there, he makes the agonized decision to go deal with a dangerous oil fire rather than stay and help the doctor deliver the baby.
When he returns, he learns that the child is dead.
This causes a temporary rift between him and his wife.
Things improve.
Stephen is promoted and assigned to a large city in the south.
The Chases becomes good friends with another couple, Don and Alice Wellman (
John Eldredge and [[Jean Muir .
Don works for Stephen, but he is so contemptuous of the Chinese that two important clients refuse to renew their contracts unless he is fired.
Stephen is torn, but does let Don go.
Don's replacement is McCarger.
Despite a prolonged drought and an outbreak of cholera, Stephen ruthlessly collects payment from his customers, earning the best record of any branch in China.
Then, communists take over the city.
An officer  shows up at the company's offices and demands the gold stored in the safe.
Stephen bargains with him and gets everyone except McCarger and himself
evacuated to a ship by promising to give up the gold in a few hours.
In the meantime, he sends for Ho , a very well-connected Chinese customer and good friend, hoping he can use his influence.
When Ho bravely shows up however, he is shot down in cold blood by the soldiers.
Outraged, Stephen and McCarger take the gold and escape out the back door.
McCarger is killed and Stephen wounded, but a passing boat rescues him and the gold.
In the hospital, he is visited by the new man in charge of the Orient for the company.
Stephen is delighted to be offered the position of his assistant.
However, when his boss outlines his plan to institute modern business practices, Stephen disagrees, explaining that, despite appearances, the "new" China is still run by the old ways.
When he recovers, he is humiliated to learn that his job has been given to another man as a result.
Further, he is given only menial tasks in an effort to get him to quit .
Hester gives Stephen's boss a tongue lashing and reveals that her husband holds the patent for a lamp the company uses to popularize the use of its product.
However, it is a call from the president of Atlantis, disturbed by the news that Stephen has been passed over for the job, that changes the man's mind.
Stephen's shaken faith in the company is restored.
Littlefoot and his friends are constantly being bullied and browbeaten by three teenage dinosaurs:
Hyp, a Hypsilophodon; Nod, a Nodosaurus; and Mutt, a Muttaburrasaurus.
However, when a shower of flying rocks impacts near the Great Valley and causes a rock slide in the Mysterious Beyond, which blocks the water supply of the Great Valley, Hyp, Nod, and Mutt are no longer the biggest worry of Littlefoot and his friends.
The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of the Great Valley, who have lived in relative peace and harmony until this event.
When the interspecies situation becomes worse and worse, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water, whereby to keep the peace in the Great Valley.
They are pursued by Hyp and his cohorts.
When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the teenagers emerge and claim the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery.
Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies and during the following pursuit, the bullies are then chased away by a wasp after Mutt accidentally called it a dummy, and the kids discover the reason for the blockage of the Great Valley’s water source.
Before they can return and tell the other Valley inhabitants the truth, the storm approaches, a lightning strike on a tree, ignites a wildfire that spreads rapidly through the dried Valley.
The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of the Mysterious
Beyond while the fire ravages their home.
When the protagonists tell the other dinosaurs of their discovery of the water's being blocked in the Mysterious Beyond by the rock slide, disunity about what to do prevents the adult dinosaurs from doing anything to utilize this knowledge.
Hyp, Mutt, and Nod set out into the Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first.
Anticipating the danger to which Hyp and his cohorts have exposed themselves, and recognizing commonality with them, Littlefoot and the others follow them, in order to help if necessary.
It becomes necessary when a pool of water Hyp enters turns out to be a dangerous tar pit.
Littlefoot and the others pull him out of the tar by combined effort.
Soon afterwards, the adult dinosaurs appear in search of their offspring and are united by the understanding that it was the unity of their children that helped them to find water.
It is implied during the discussion thereof that Hyp's own experience of harsh treatment by his father is the cause of his harshness toward others after he bullies Littlefoot and the others and leads the argument of Cera's father and Littlefoot's grandfather with Cera's dad calling Littlefoot a bad influence enraging Grandpa which he causes, and implied later that being treated kindly
improves the temperaments of Hyp and his sidekicks.
Before they are able to take further steps, the herd is attacked by a pack of four small Sharpteeth.
The following pursuit leads to the bed of the now dry river that flows through the Great Valley and exactly to the spot where a dam of boulders created by the rockslide has blocked the river.
During the following encounter between the sharpteeth and the herbivorous dinosaurs, the unity of the children &mdash; a group which now includes Hyp and his cronies &mdash; proves elemental.
Cera's father, Littlefoot's grandfather, and later Hyp's father keep the sharpteeth occupied while Cera and the now placid teenagers succeed in breaking the dam.
They all watch as the freed water washes away the sharpteeth .
The herbivores return to the Valley, which now has enough water for them, although the fire has destroyed most of the plants on which they feed.
Working together, the dinosaurs survive the time until the plants start to grow again by feeding on the last remains of the plants, moving from one verdant area to another and sharing everything they find; a behavior which gives this time its name “The Time of the Great Giving”.
In Los Angeles, California Fletcher Reede  is a career-focused lawyer and divorced father.
He loves spending time with his young son Max ([[Justin Cooper ; they often play a game where Fletcher makes his hand into "the Claw" and pretends to chase Max with it.
But Fletcher has a habit of giving precedence to his job, breaking promises to Max and his ex-wife Audrey , and then lying about the reasons.
Fletcher's compulsive lying has also built him a reputation as one of the best defense lawyers in the state of California as he is climbing the ladder in the firm for which he works.
Ultimately, Fletcher misses his son's fifth birthday party because he is having sex with his boss Miranda , in the hopes of making partner.
Max makes a birthday wish that his father would be unable to tell a lie for an entire day &mdash; a wish that immediately becomes true.
Fletcher soon discovers, through a series of embarrassing incidents &mdash; such as when he tells Miranda that he has "had better" sex than he just did with her &mdash; that he is unable to lie, mislead, or even withhold a true answer.
These incidents are inconvenient, as he is fighting a divorce case in court which, should he win, could be a huge boost to his career.
His client is the self-centered, money grabbing Samantha Cole .
His main witness is willing to commit perjury to win, but
Fletcher discovers that he cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer will be a lie; during the case he even objects to himself when he tries to lie to get the desired information.
Meanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to Boston with her new boyfriend Jerry , and decides that Max is going with them so that she can protect him from getting hurt by Fletcher.
Fletcher tries desperately to delay the case, even beating himself up, but he cannot conceal that he is able to continue, so the judge  insists that he does.
Finally he realizes that his client had lied about her age and therefore had signed her prenuptial agreement while a minor, rendering it invalid.
This allows him to win his case truthfully, but the repercussions become a catalyst to his understanding of what he himself is about to lose.
Samantha who only cared about her ex-husband's money, takes custody of her children purely so her ex-husband would be forced to continue paying her for child care and literally pulls the children out of the arms of their responsible and caring father.
Fletcher then has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge to reverse the decision, and is taken to jail for contempt of court.
Audrey refuses to pay his bail, which is eventually paid by his secretary Greta , who forgives him for his earlier rude truth-tellings after hearing he "went all noble" in front of their firm's senior partner.
Now recognizing his son Max as his highest priority, Fletcher struggles to keep him.
He hurries to the airport, but Audrey and Max's plane has already left the terminal.
Desperate, he hijacks a mobile stairway and pursues the plane onto the runway.
The plane finally stops, but Fletcher is injured.
On his way to the hospital, he vows to his son to spend more time with him and never hurt him again.
Even though the 24 hours of truth are up, Max knows he means it, and Audrey decides not to move to Boston with Jerry after all.
One year later, Fletcher and Audrey are celebrating Max's birthday.
The lights go off when Max blows out his birthday candles.
When they go back on, Fletcher and Audrey are kissing.
Fletcher asks Max if he wished for his mom and his dad to get back together and Max replies "
No, I wished for roller blades!
The family seemingly returns to normal as Fletcher chases Audrey and Max around the house with "the Claw".
In 1927, young belle Charlotte Hollis  and her married lover, John Mayhew , plan to elope during a party at the Hollis family's antebellum mansion in Ascension Parish, Louisiana.
However, after Charlotte's father intimidates him, telling him that John's wife had visited the day before and revealed the affair, John pretends he no longer loves Charlotte and tells her they must part.
John is then brutally murdered and decapitated in the summerhouse with a cleaver, with one hand severed.
Charlotte discovers the body.
She returns traumatized to the party in a bloodied dress, leading most to presume that she is the murderer.
The story jumps to 1964.
Charlotte is now a wealthy spinster, still living on the plantation home that has been in her family for generations.
Charlotte's father died the year after Mayhew's murder, believing his daughter guilty.
Charlotte has believed all these years that her father killed Mayhew, but everyone else assumes that it was Charlotte, the crazy recluse, who decapitated her lover.
The story picks up as the Louisiana Highway Commission is making preparations to demolish her house and build a new highway through the property.
Charlotte is vehemently against this and ignores the eviction notice, refusing to leave.
She keeps the foreman , his demolition crew, and the bulldozer away by shooting at them with a rifle.
They temporarily give up and leave.
Charlotte is living with her housekeeper, Velma , in the Hollis mansion.
Seeking help in her fight against the Highway Commission, she calls upon Miriam , a poor cousin who lived with the family as a girl.
Miriam renews her relationship with Drew Bayliss , a local doctor who jilted her after the murder.
Charlotte's sanity deteriorates with Miriam's arrival, her nights haunted by a mysterious harpsichord playing the song
Mayhew wrote for her and by the appearance of Mayhew's disembodied hand and head.
Velma, suspecting that Miriam and Drew are after Charlotte's money, seeks help from Mr. Willis , an insurance investigator who is still interested in the Mayhew case and who has visited Mayhew's ailing widow, Jewel .
Miriam fires Velma, who later returns and discovers that Charlotte is being drugged.
Miriam sees the housekeeper trying to take Charlotte out of the house.
The two argue at the top of the stairs.
Velma tries to escape, but knowing Velma has discovered the drugs, Miriam smashes a chair over her head.
Velma falls down the stairs to her death.
One night, a drugged Charlotte runs downstairs in the grip of a hallucination, believing John has returned to her.
Miriam and Drew decide to trick Charlotte into shooting Drew with a gun loaded with blanks, after which Miriam helps dispose of the "body" in a swamp.
Charlotte returns to the house and sees the supposedly dead Drew at the top of the stairs, reducing her to whimpering insanity.
Now believing Charlotte completely mad and secure in her room, Miriam and Drew go into the garden to discuss their plan: to drive Charlotte insane in order to get her money.
Miriam also tells Drew that back in 1927 she saw Jewel murder her husband.
She's been using this knowledge to blackmail Jewel for all these years, while plotting to gain possession of Charlotte's wealth.
Charlotte overhears all.
She moves toward a huge stone urn on the ledge of the balcony, almost directly over the lovers' heads.
Miriam embraces Drew, then the two look up and into Charlotte's knowing eyes.
They are paralyzed by the sight as Charlotte tips the stone urn off the ledge, crushing them both to death.
The next morning, the authorities take Charlotte away, presumably to an insane asylum.
Many neighbors and locals gather at the Hollis home to watch the proceedings, believing that crazy Charlotte has murdered again.
Willis hands her an envelope from the now-dead Jewel Mayhew, who has had a stroke after hearing of the incident the previous night.
The note contains Jewel's confession to the murder of her husband.
As the authorities drive Charlotte away, she looks back at her beloved plantation, apparently for the last time.
The story is based on the requirement of Spanish land owners in California to register their lands before a deadline and the chicanery practiced by some to prevent registration.
Set in the 1960s, the film follows the lead character Kent , as he travels along the California coast.
As he drifts, he recalls his former troubled girlfriend,
Bobbi  who committed suicide after he broke off their relationship.
During his travels he meets up with different women.
However, he moves along rather than stay put in hopes of finding a meaning to his life.
In the winter of 1945, immediately after the liberation, Jean Diego , a member of the French underground during World War II, meets Raymond, one of his comrades in arm who was believed to have succumbed in battle.
On that same night, Jean encounters a homeless man named "Destiny", whose predictions about him finding the woman of his life won't be too far from reality.
Jean soon starts a liaison with Malou, a young woman married to a rich man.
The next hours of his and Malou's lives are underscored by extreme, dramatic events; however, as the clochard  predicted, they find their way out of struggle and are able to move on, leaving behind wartime and its dangers.
The film is based rather loosely on the play, adds an entire backstory before O'Neill's actual play begins, and includes several new characters that do not appear in it .
Some people consider the movie to be just a vehicle for showing off Robeson's musical talent .
However, the film does provide what may be Robeson's greatest dramatic performance in a movie, considered by many to be worthy of an Oscar nomination that it did not receive.
In the film version, the opening shots are of an African ritual dance.
Some critics are quick to assess the opening as representative of the "primitive" black world to which Brutus Jones will eventually revert.
However, more scholarly-based reviews of the film understand the complexities of the allusion to and comparison between the roots of the African American church and the rhythmic chanting often seen in African religious practices.
A quick dissolve takes us into a Baptist church in the American South, where the dancing of the congregation presents an image that argues for a continuity between the "savage" Africans and the ring-shout Baptists.
Such suggestive editing may be the kind of element that causes viewers to suspect the film of racism.
Similarly, the film makes copious use of the word "nigger", as did O'Neill's original play.
African Americans criticized O'Neill's language at the time, so its preservation and expansion in the film present another cause for critique.
Given Robeson's subsequent career as a Civil Rights activist, the spectacle of his character using the term so frequently in regard to other blacks seems shocking today.
As for the plot, Brutus Jones has just been hired as a Pullman Porter, a job that served the upward mobility of thousands of African American men in the first half of the twentieth-century.
Jones proudly shows off his uniform to his girlfriend Dolly , setting up the contrast with the later scenes in which "the Emperor Jones" parades around in overdone military garb.
But Jones is quickly corrupted by the lures of the big city, taking up with fast women and gamblers.
One boisterous crap game leads to a fight in which he inadvertently stabs Jeff, the man who had introduced him to the fast-life and from whom he had stolen the affections of the beautiful Undine .
A stint on the chain gang allows the film its first opportunity to show Robeson without his shirt on, an exposure of male nudity unusual for 1933 and certainly for a black actor.
Here and later the director plays on Robeson's sexual power and, implicitly, on cultural stereotypes about the libidinal power of black men.
Jones escapes the convict's life after striking a white guard who was torturing and beating another prisoner.
Making his way home, he briefly receives the assistance of his wife before taking a job stoking coal on a steamer headed for the Caribbean.
One day, he catches sight of a remote island and jumps ship, swimming to the island.
The island is under the crude rule of a top-hatted black despot who receives merchandise from Smithers, the dilapidated white colonial merchant who is the sole Caucasian on the island.
Jones rises to become Smithers' partner and eventually "Emperor".
He dethrones his predecessor with a trick that allows him to survive what appears to be a fusillade of bullets, creating the myth that he can only be slain by a silver one.
Jones's rule of the island involves increasing taxes on the poor natives and pocketing the proceeds.
The highlight is a twenty-five minute spoken monologue taken directly from O'Neill's play, in which Brutus Jones , hunted by natives in revolt, flees through the jungle and slowly disintegrates psychologically, becoming a shrieking hysteric who runs right into the path of his pursuers.
A group of journalists are investigating a highly secret document when they uncover a sensational story: that even before the Second World War, in 1938, the first rocket was made in the USSR and Soviet scientists were planning to send an orbiter to the moon and back.
The evidence is convincing; it is clear that in this case, Soviet cosmonauts were first.
The movie follows the selection and training of a small group of cosmonauts.
The one who shines above the others  is Captain Ivan Sergeyevich Kharlamov .
He is helped into a space suit and loaded into the capsule, and the rocket lifts off for the Moon—but contact with it is soon lost.
Most of the remainder of the film seems to follow the search for information about what happened next, as the 1930s space program appears to have dissolved immediately after, with no reason given .
It is implied that Kharlamov returned to Earth, but with no fanfare and apparently no assistance from the space program.
A number of men are shown as suspected of being Kharlamov—the NKVD seems to be conducting a criminal investigation of the program and it is implied that those involved, including Kharlamov himself, are in hiding.
It seems that the capsule returned to Earth and landed in Chile, and that Kharlamov journeyed to the Soviet Far East by way of Polynesia and China, yet feared capture on his return.
His wife apparently covered for him when interrogated as to his whereabouts.
The narrator never ties the story together coherently, however; the interviews and footage are shown without supporting commentary, in a narration style reminiscent of an actual documentary of the Soviet lunar program,
The Red Stuff.http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/282742/The-Red-Stuff-The-True-Story-of-the-Russian-Race-for-Space/overview
The very end of the movie shows the only footage of the mission itself after launch, explaining it as a film which was found at the Chilean landing site and is currently in the possession of "the Natural museum in the town of Antafagasta".
First there is a brief clip showing Kharlamov piloting the vehicle, presumably on final approach to the Moon.
Following that is an equally brief panorama of a lunar landscape with the capsule or lander  resting on the surface, apparently taken by Kharlamov during lunar EVA.
Both scenes are shown as stills on the movie's cover.
Then there is a short clip of the other cosmonauts walking through a hangar with the 1930s space program director, and the credits roll.
During a routine walk home, advertising executive Murray  runs into Carter , a would-be mugger.
After a struggle, Murray strikes Carter in the face with his briefcase and proceeds to walk away.
Murray notices that the mugger is part of a small gang, which begins to chase him.
Fearing for his life, he climbs a tree to evade capture, but finds himself unable to leave when the gang decides to wait for him to come down.
Attempts to call for help are useless, as Murray had been forced to give up his possessions to his attackers.
As the night rolls in, the gang slowly becomes desperate and tries to force Murray out of the tree, but find themselves accidentally providing him with weapons and hostages.
The night continues and through several events, the two sides learn the importance of human life and begin to change.
It is spring.
Randy Dean is a high school senior with poor grades, only one school friend , secret cigarette and marijuana habits and a cashier’s job at a gas station with Regina.
She is pursuing a dead-end relationship with Wendy, a married woman who drops by the gas station when it pleases her.
This often entails a follow-up visit from her jealous husband, Ali, who roughs Randy up and orders her to stay away from Wendy.
One day Evie Roy stops in a pristine Range Rover, unsure if her tires need air.
Randy recognizes her from school and talks to her for the first time.
Evie is an only child living with her well-off, cultured mother, Evelyn, who has a difficult relationship with her  husband.
Randy and Evie start passing notes in school and hanging out with each other, although Evie does not reveal this to her cliquish friends.
They hang out in meadows, trading music  and talking.
At the gas station, Randy rejects an angry Wendy, claiming she has a new girlfriend, Evie.
Evie breaks up with her boyfriend after he complains of her distant attitude towards him.
Later, apparently on a spur of the moment, she lends Randy a copy of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, which Randy starts to devour.
Inviting Evie to her family’s small house for dinner, Randy reveals to her that she has lived with her lesbian aunt Rebecca and Rebecca's lover Vicky since Randy's mother abandoned her to devote all her time to an Operation Rescue-like group.
On the front steps of Rebecca's house, they kiss for the first time.
Evie records it in her diary later, apparently wondering what it all means.
Randy and Evie experiment with how “out” they can be as lesbians, nervously holding hands at a local diner.
Remembering Randy
’s warning of how intolerant the town can be, Evie nevertheless breaks the news to her three closest friends.
One girl is supportive , but the other two are hostile to the idea: one of them says, “God, Evie, if you were gonna turn gay
you think you could at least choose someone who’s pretty.”
Randy’s grades continue to plummet and the school warns her she will not graduate; Randy hides this information from Rebecca.
When Evie’s mother leaves on a business trip, the girls take the opportunity to cook a huge meal, indulging in wine and marijuana.
That night, they make love, then fall asleep in Evie’s mother’s bed.
The next morning, Evelyn returns prematurely.
The kitchen is a mess and used wine glasses are scattered about.
Furiously searching the upstairs, she discovers the girls but does not recognize Randy as a girl until she runs past her on her way out.
Meanwhile, Rebecca has learned that Randy will not be graduating high school, and she, Vicky and her ex-girlfriend Lena go to Frank’s house, where Randy had told them she would be staying the night.
Rebecca threatens Frank
until, panicked, he turns over Evie’s phone number.

Pierre suffers from amnesia after a war-time accident in which he might have killed a young Vietnamese girl while crash-landing his stricken plane.
His nurse-girlfriend Madeleine lives with him on a low-key but potentially romantic basis.
Pierre then sees Cybèle, a young girl in distress as she is being dropped off at an orphanage by an obviously unloving father.
Eventually, he pretends to be the girl's father, which allows her to get away from the locked orphanage, and he spends time with her every Sunday, for months.
Both are lonely, childlike, and in need of a supportive friend.

When she tells Bernard, a doctor who has a romantic interest in her, about the ongoing relationship between Pierre and Cybèle, he believes the girl to be in danger.
He notifies the police of the situation, who also misread the intentions of the young man.
Pierre has nothing to give Cybèle for Christmas, so he takes up her earlier joking challenge to bring her the metal rooster on top of a Gothic church near the orphanage.
Being a former pilot, he musters the nerve to climb the 300 foot steeple, and uses his knife as a tool to unscrew and bring down the rooster.
He approaches the girl, carrying the metal rooster and his knife.
However, at this point, the police arrive and shoot him dead to "protect" the child, whom they think is in danger.
Cybèle, who had fallen asleep waiting to meet Pierre for their Christmas together in the snow
covered park's gazebo, is devastated by witnessing the pointless killing of her friend.

Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast.
One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her.

When she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession.
However, she soon recants and is publicly executed.

It is New Year's Day of 2006, more than a year after the events of Night Watch.
Anton Gorodetsky, the protagonist of the first film, finds himself in the middle of an approaching conflict between the Light and Dark Others, who are still bound with an uneasy truce.
Anton is still a Night Watch operative, now working with his trainee and romantic interest, Svetlana.
As his son Yegor has now become a Dark Other, Anton is forced to secretly destroy evidence of Yegor's attacks on normal people, which violates the treaty, leaving the Night Watch unable to sentence Yegor.
To redeem for his previous mistake, an attempt to use a witch's service to kill the unborn Yegor , Anton seeks the legendary Chalk of Fate, a magical chalk that could rewrite history, which was once Tamerlane's property and one of the main reasons for his numerous military successes.
Meanwhile, Zavulon, the leader of the Dark Others and their Day Watch, is waiting for Yegor's birthday.
At the birthday, Yegor would become a Great Other and acquire the power that would allow the Dark Others to break the treaty .
Zavulon's gratitude to Anton for covering Yegor's violations of the treaty doesn't stop him and the Day Watch from attempting to frame Anton for murder and bring him in front of the Inquisition.
They succeed, despite the efforts made by Geser, the head of the Night Watch, to protect Anton from the Dark Others by putting him in Olga's body.
While in her body, Svetlana confesses that she loves Anton to the person she thinks is Olga, which pushes their relationship forward.
This happens despite Svetlana's initial anger at Anton for not telling her that he was in Olga's body.
Anton obtains the Chalk of Fate from its hiding place in a Central Asian cafe in Moscow and uses it to summon Yegor.
They initially get on well, but Yegor is resentful when Anton refuses his request to patch things up with Yegor's mother.
Anton puts his large coat on Yegor, who seems to be cold, and leaves to order food.
At this time, Svetlana rings Anton's mobile, which he left in the pocket of the coat, and Yegor, angry at her intrusion into his relationship with his absentee father, yells at her, "He has a family.
Don't call again."
He smashes the phone and leaves with the chalk, which he takes to Zavulon.
Zavulon cannot use or even touch the Chalk, because doing so would be a direct violation of the treaty, so he has Yegor give it to his minion/lover Alisia to do with as she wishes, although it is implied that Zavulon knows what she will do with it.
Yegor's birthday party begins soon after that; the guests are Dark Others , although Anton makes his way to the party as Yegor's father to expose the real perpetrator of the murder he has been charged with - his vampire neighbor, Kostya's father.
He is unable, however, to avert a disaster:
as Svetlana rushes to the party to find Anton, Yegor confronts her.
She tries to avoid a conflict but Yegor repeatedly challenges her and expresses resentment at her relationship with his father; Svetlana accidentally strikes Yegor and spills a drop of his blood, which Zavulon interprets as a violation of the Treaty and thus uses as a pretense to declare all-out war on the Light Others.
Yegor, now a Great Other, unleashes an apocalypse upon Moscow, killing most of the guests and blinding Svetlana.
The city is nearly destroyed, starting with the Ostankino Tower; a fierce battle between the Light and Dark Others follows, with few survivors on either side.
In the midst of the chaos, Anton, who survives, finds Alisia who is trying to revive her dead lover, Kostya, but without success.
She cannot revive him because her actions did not cause his death.
The scene implies the user of the Chalk can only change decisions that he or she made, not anyone else's.
Anton convinces Alisia to give him the Chalk so that he can prevent the destruction of Moscow and the deaths of scores of Others, but is almost immediately caught by a panicked Svetlana and an enraged Yegor.
The two Great Others fight for Anton, but nearly kill him in the process.
Saved at the last minute by Geser, Anton runs through the ruins of Moscow to the house where he, fourteen years ago, made his visit to the witch &mdash; the visit that caused the entire sequence of events, starting Anton's own initiation into the Night Watch.
Anton writes NO  on a wall in this house.
Moscow reverts to its normal, undemolished state and the film returns to 1992 and the first scene of Night Watch.
In the epilogue, as a result of the Chalk's influence, Anton rethinks his deal with the witch, and therefore never inadvertently agrees to harm his wife's unborn child, who would have been Yegor.
He walks out of the house and into the street, where he meets Svetlana.
Zavulon and Geser watch them from a park bench, eager to see if Anton will recognize Svetlana, despite now having never met her because of the rewriting of history.
Geser's prediction turns out to be accurate; despite not knowing how or why, Anton recognizes Svetlana
and they walk off together, implicitly striking up a less harried relationship than the one they have/had in the first film.
In 1947, the movie's narrator, Stingo , relocates to Brooklyn in order to write a novel and is befriended by Sophie Zawistowski , a Polish immigrant, and her lover, Nathan Landau .
One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her.
There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S.
Sophie  eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer.
Sophie had a lover, Józef , who lived with his half-sister, Wanda , a leader in the Resistance.
Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children.
Two weeks later Józef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children.
Nathan tells Sophie and Stingo that the research he is doing at a pharmaceutical company is so groundbreaking that he will win the Nobel Prize.
At a meeting with Nathan's physician brother, Stingo learns that Nathan is mentally ill  and that all of the schools that Nathan had attended were "expensive funny farms."  After Nathan discharges a firearm over the telephone in a violent rage, Sophie and Stingo flee to a hotel.
She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz.
Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp.
To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan , to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva , to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two.
Sophie and Stingo make love, but while Stingo is sleeping, Sophie, tormented by her memory, returns to Nathan.
Sophie and Nathan commit suicide by taking cyanide.
Stingo recites the poem
"Ample Make This Bed" by Emily Dickinson—the American poet Sophie
was fond of reading.
Stingo moves away from Brooklyn to a small farm his father recently inherited in southern Virginia to finish writing his novel.
Claire, a mild-mannered parking attendant, lives in a small flat with her mother who is recovering from a recent stroke.
In the opening sequence she patrols the Los Angeles streets and stumbles into an old flame, who introduces Claire to his wife and ill-behaved daughter.
Reeling from the chance encounter, she steps out onto the street and is hit by a passing vehicle.
Returning to work, Claire attracts the attention of another parking attendant, an extremely blunt and aggressive man named Jay whose home life consists mainly of entertaining himself using the services of a webcam porn site and phone service.
Claire witnesses him fighting with her best friend, a neighbor working for a delivery service who parks on the curb to unload her consignment, but does not bring it up with either party.
She develops a crush on Jay, but in each conversation Jay takes issue with some entirely innocuous comment Claire has made and storms off in disgust.
Nonetheless, he keeps coming back for more.
One night as Claire prepares to join him at the office party, she finds her mother slumped over—dead—in a bowl of mashed potato.
In shock, she simply picks up her coat and leaves for the party.
She sits alone, watching Jay dance with another woman, until finally Jay asks in brutal terms what is the matter.
She takes him home to show him the problem.
Claire decides that rather than call an ambulance she prefers to have the situation dealt with by family.
She calls her mother's vain and self-obsessed sister, who lives in a different part of the city.
Her aunt says it is too far to come at that hour of the night, but if she wants to, Claire can come pick up a necklace belonging to her mother.
Jay insists on staying the night to "take care" of Claire, promising to sleep on the couch.
But he goes to Claire's narrow bed and starts to remove her clothes.
After a few seconds of brutal thrusting, during which he talks to her as if she were the phone sex service he uses so frequently, he rolls over and falls asleep.
From that point on, Jay and Claire maintain a tenuous sort of relationship, hung mainly on Claire's optimism and Jay's desire for sex and attention.
At work, Jay is suspended for his aggressive behavior with parking offenders, which has earned him an impressive complaints record.
He watches a crafts documentary on carpentry and decides to make a love seat.
Jay offers to drive Claire to her aunt's house to pick up her mother's necklace, lying to her over his disciplining at work.
He drives her to the other side of the city, with her seated on the makeshift love seat in his parking attendant's vehicle.
Her aunt insists that they all go out drinking; Jay and Claire end up in a hotel room.
Jay gives Claire a tiny, pink PVC bikini and tells her she should lose weight, which Claire takes in stride, as she has previously with his other insinuations and outright insults.
During her next shift, Claire is informed that she is being promoted for her exemplary behavior.
To celebrate she goes to Jay's apartment but swiftly realizes that he was visited by a prostitute immediately before her arrival.
She leaves in disgust.
Jay goes to her apartment to apologize.
Dressed in a more fashionable and confident style, she is outspokenly skeptical about his behavior, but submits when he pulls her to the floor for another round of uncomfortable sex.
When it is over, Jay expresses that he has burgeoning feelings of commitment to Claire, but she asks him to leave.
In the end, Claire once again walks her beat alone.
Another vehicle nearly catches her at the site of her prior accident, but this time she escapes unscathed, and smiles in relief.

Ninja Resurrection takes place in the Tokugawa era, at a time when Christians in Japan were being persecuted.
The leader of the Shimabara Rebellion, Amakusa Shirō, hoped to resist the government forces attacking Christians like him but is assassinated.
Soon after, Amakusa's restless spirit returns to avenge his fallen comrades and is up to Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi to put a stop to the demonic onslaught.  
Jubei's Revenge begins a narration of the timepiece explaining the era, the war between toyotomi and tokugawa, the events that led up to the Shimabara rebellion, and a dark satanic prophecy about Shiro.
Along with the narration there are Japanese paintings of these events.
The first OVA called "The Cant
Of Hell" shows a small band of soldiers raiding a village outside of Harano Castle, and smashing a statue of Madonna.
All the villagers hide except for a little boy who they shoot.
After the soldiers leave to report the Christian rebels to the shogun, a small girl named 'Ocho' runs to the boy's body and begs him to wake up.
The boy, who is Shiro, miraculously revives and shows the approaching villagers that the bullet hit a crucifix he had.
Sunlight shines through the clouds onto shiro and he raises the crucifix and a long beam of light shoots from it up into the sky.
The villagers bowdown and worship Shiro and declare him to be 'Tenshi', the son of jehovah and the returned messiah and their saviour.
The Madonna statue reforms.
An evil-looking man in the bushes watches the events as they unfold and smiles.
55 years later, an army of government soldiers attack Harano castle in a fog but are killed by an onslaught of arrows.
Inside the castle, the evil-looking man, who is revealed to be 'Soy Kanmoiri', gives a speech declaring their victory against the heretics.
The Christians boisterously support him and declare that as long as they have Lord Shiro they will kill the Tokugawa and make all the lands Christian.
After the speech, Lord Shiro speaks privately to Soy, informing him that the food supply exhausted two days ago
and they were fighting on mere willpower.
He opts to use the recent advantage to surrender himself in exchange for the lives of his people, but Soy says no and that he must have faith and that if they lose faith now then all they believed in would be a lie.
Shiro tells Soy they can't win the war and everyone will die.
Elsewhere, General Nobutsuna Matsudaira speaks with his commanders about the recent defeat.
He is told that more than 500 were killed.
Nobutsuna recognizes that the Christians are using black magic.
Jubei arrives and tells Nobutsuna that the army will not breech the wall
and he has a plan.
Jubei then swiftly leaves.
5 months earlier the shogun had sent an army of 100,000 men to defeat the Christians, whom had attacked and seized Harano castle.
The shogun, outraged that his army was defeated by peasants and farmers, sent Nobutsuna Matsudaira to destroy the Christians by any means.
Nobutsuna orders all his men to attack the castle anyway.
Miyamoto Musashi observes the army moving-out, from a faraway cliff.
He declares that the army will not be able to penetrate and the men are being sacrificed uselessly.
He then runs to join the army but sees a massive kite in the sky and comments on the ingenuity of this new approach.
The extremely huge kite, tethered to someplace, floats high in the clouds above Harano castle.
Jubei and four other ninjas are standing on a narrow platform on the kite.
They leap from the platform through a lightningstorm and float down to the castle using capes.
Using the aerial assault, Jubei and his four ninjas enter the castle and begin easily slicing the Christians in half.
One ninja in particular who has a penchant for explosives detonates a wave of explosions throughout the castle.
There is intense fighting with lots of blood.
Nobutsuna's army uses a battering-ram to enter the castle, and the soldiers battle their enemies.
Shiro gathers the women, kids, and old people into a part of the castle that the soldiers can't enter because it is protected by a seal.
He promises to protect them with the power of god.
However, the four ninjas know about this seal and the four barriers that are maintaining the seal.
Each one destroys a barrier.
Shiro is alerted to the destruction of the seal.
Shiro senses Jubei and refers to him as a "mighty power that will kill us".
Jubei slices a bunch of men and then comes across two kids whom he wall-runs past.
The kids tell Soy, who smiles and slashes them.
Jubei meets Shiro on a roof and Shiro bargains with him to spare the lives of the women and children if he commits seppuku.
Shiro takes a tanto to kill himself but is stopped by Soy who shows him the decapitated heads of the two kids and tells him not to trust Jubei.
Shiro goes ballistic and uses his magic to summon a lot of power into himself.
He then uses the power of psychokinesis to destroy the roof and fire the tanto and shingles at Jubei.
Shiro then summons a black dragon with which he attacks Jubei.
Miyamoto, who has entered the castle, is easily slicing through Christian soldiers as he watches the events.
Jubei tries to slice the dragon in half but it proves useless.
He then flees but the dragon catches up to him.
He holds on to the snout of the dragon as it flies through buildings and into the sky.
Shiro emerges from the top of the dragon's head and begins strangling Jubei.
Two of the ninjas try to assist Jubei by firing harpoons at the dragon but it breaks free.
The biggest and strongest of the ninjas tells those two to stay put.
He and the ninja who likes explosives perform a tactical attack.
The ninja who likes explosives, opens up a bazooka and fires it at the dragon but it has little effect.
The tall ninja, who attacks from a different angle, extends a folding metal suit of armour over his body, originating from two small shoulder pads.
The armor gives him rocket propulsion and he flies into the dragon, causing massive damage.
Jubei cuts off Shiro's hands and falls to earth.
The dragon's head is still alive and sneaks up behind jubei.
Jubei holds up the children's heads and hesitates Shiro mid-attack.
He then throws his sword at Shiro, spearing him in the chest.
The impact rips Shiro from the dragon's head and flings him into a window of the main chapel.
The tall ninja lands and his armour folds back up into his shoulder pads.  
The second OVA is called "Hell's Spawn".
It begins by showing a younger Jubei kill five samurai with ease.
Jubei's father, Munenori Yagyu, scolds him for his constant murders but Jubei makes excuses.
Munenori challenges Jubei to a duel; warning him that he will not hesitate just because Jubei is his son.
Jubei attacks but restrains himself and only slashes Munenori's shirt.
Munenori jumps into the air and tosses a kunai into Jubei's eye.
As Jubei stays bleeding, his father states that he knew Jubei would not attack him and used this knowledge against Jubei.
Munenori tells Jubei that he must never lose and should exploit every weakness of his opponent and that he can't rely on strength alone.
Jubei tells his father that he doesn't need his father's platitudes and that he is stronger than his father ever would be.
Munenori banishes Jubei from his house and lands.
There is a historical narration about the strongest swordsmen of the time and how swordmanship became a science and evolved.
The samurai's discussed are Musashi Miyamoto, Mataemon Araki, Inshun Hosowei, Botaro Tamiya, Munenori Yagyu, and Jubei Yagyu.
It states that their battles are legendary but their deaths are shrouded in mystery; for example, Musashi disappeared in foggy mountains and Mataemon was poisoned by an unknown person.
Several months after the Shimabara Riot, Jubei is resting under a tree when he starts to have memories of the riot and all the bodies.
An old man is riding into the Yagyu lands when he spots a boy and a girl spear-fishing.
The girl keeps nagging the boy and he dunks her into the water.
The old man rides on towards the Yagyu estate.
The girl jumps onto Jubei and pretends to be frighten of a snake.
She then confesses how much she likes Jubei.
When the old man, whose name is Jushin Sagoguichi, enters the estate he is dismayed that it is in ruin and that some walls are broken down.
A servant tells him that lord Jubei allowed it to get that way.
Jubei and the two children arrive and it turns out that Jushin is the children's father.
Inside the house, Jushin scolds his daughter for not being lady-like and scolds his son, who is his heir, for doing servant's chores.
Jubei tries to calm him down with sake.
Another young girl, named Ohina, enters the room bringing food.
She speaks graciously to Lord Jushin and Jushin compliments her on how beautiful she has become since he last saw her.
As Jushin and Jubei eat, Jushin tells them that the shogun, Yorinobu, has requested that all unmarried girls of noble birth between the ages of 15-23 should be brought to Kishu.
Jubei finds the mandate strange.
Onwei, Jushin's daughter, protests stating she wants to stay with Jubei.
Jushin tells Jubei that the shogun is amassing a large army and gathering lots of food and it looks like he is going to increase taxes.
He also tells Jubei that many strange men have been coming to the capital.
Jushin also tells Jubei that many girls have gone missing.
Jubei invites Jushin to watch the girls spar.
In the morning, Ohina demonstrates her skills with a naginata by defeating a lot of men in a sparring match.
Onwei then challenges Ohina and the two battle to a standstill.
Jushin compliments them on their improvement and soon afterwards leaves with them to Kishu.
Before Onwei leaves, she reminds Jubei to bathe at least once every three days and to wear clean clothes.
As Jubei watches them go, he tells his servant to send a spy to watch the castle in Kishu and that he,Jubei, would be gone for five days.
Somenight later, at Shosetsu Yui's residence in Edo, Ohina is attacked and raped by a born-again Inshun Hosowei.
As he slowly rapes her, he licks her breasts and plays around with her.
After he is finished raping Ohina, he kills her.
Mataemon Araki, who is sitting nearby, comments on how Inshun likes doing that.
Inshun retorts that Mataemon does the same thing.
As Mataemon constantly stabs a kunai into his hand, he says that today he doesn't feel like killing girls but wants to kill rats.
The two men are being spied on by a ninja.
Mataemon suddenly leaps into the trees and slowly kills the ninja.
Two more ninjas attack him.
He kills one and chases the other.
The ninja flees across rooftops but Mataemon is faster than him.
Mataemon calls the ninja a mouse.
The ninja calls up other ninjas to assist him.
Mataemon tells them his name and how it has been a while since he killed a man.
The ninjas believe he is lying about his identity.
Mataemon removes the scarf covering the lower half of his face and tells them he is "a born again".
The ninja tells him "then you will die again".
All the ninjas attack him at once, impaling him on several swords.
Mataemon condescends the ninjas' futile attack.
He pops the swords out of his body, along with his intestines.
He then unsheathes his own sword and uses it along with his dangling intestines to attack and slay the shinobis.
Two shinobi escape him.
One backs into a dark corner and is quickly sliced to pieces by a resurrected Botaro Tamiya.
Botaro tosses a dagger into the other ninja
but he replaces himself with a cat.
Mataemon yells at Botaro for ruining his fun.
At Tajima-no-Kami Yagyu residence, the ninja who survived, whose name is Godaiyu, reports to Munenori Yagyu.
He tells him that Lord Yorinobu in Kishu is organizing an army of ronin and that inhuman creatures were appearing.
He also tells Munenori that he saw ghosts: Mataemon, Inshun, Botaro.
Munenori doesn't believe him and scolds him for drinking.
He tells Munenori he wasn't drinking.
Munenori says that those men were some of the most skilled killers, and he ponders what Shosetsu is planning.
He then begins coughing uncontrollably.
Godaiyu says that Jubei would be useful.
Munenori yells at him to never mention that name, and Godaiyu apologises.
Munenori tells him to continue observing Shosetsu, and Godaiyu slides away into the darkness.
Jubei is walking through a fog in the woods when he comes upon a small hut.
Inside the hut, Jubei talks to an old man about the prophecy of 'Tenshi'.
The old man asks if Jubei really believes in Satan and reminds Jubei that he saw Shiro's staked head.
The old man informs Jubei that he has people familiar with underground paths and will be able to use them in case of battle.
The old man then tells Jubei that Jubei is too young to quit being a warrior.
Jubei tells him he is tired of murdering in the name of duty.
The old man asks Jubei how many persons he killed but Jubei tells him that he lost count.
The old man says that he should take a break and rest a little.
The old man also says that Jubei reminds him of an old friend named Musashi Miyamoto, who strove to excel everyone in swordmanship and now lives as a hermit in the mountains.
As the old man talks to Jubei, a little boy leaves Musashi's house thanking him for the lessons.
Musashi's house is dug into the side of a mountain.
Inside is very spacious with large gigantic statues of numerous warriors.
Musashi recollects the Shimabara revolt and watching Jubei fight.
He questions if he would be able to defeat Jubei.
Musashi then picks up a paintbrush and begins tirelessly drawing a lot of buddhist pictures.
Later that night, in Edo, during a full moon; Soiken Mori, Shosetsu Yui, Botaro, Inshun and Mataemon, stand on an altar in a room, surrounding Ocho who is laying down.
They all start chanting "Satan".
A cloud blankets the moon, causing the room to darken.
Suddenly the moon turns red, the wind blows strongly, and electricity starts flashing within the room.
Shosetsu asks Soiken what's happening but Soiken tells him to be silent.
Ocho starts levitating.
Her body starts convulsing wildly as her clothes fall off.
Suddenly, she exhales an enormous cloud of smog.
The smog shapeshifts into a crucifix, then the virgin Mary, then into the Devil.
After maintaining its Devil form for a few moments, the smog then returns to Ocho's body.
The men stand silently, staring at Ocho.
A big bulbous growth forms in Ocho's throat and crawls under her skin to her belly, where it turns into faces and then stretches and pulls Ocho's skin chaotically as it wriggles about.
Suddenly, many long strands of silver hair fire out of Ocho's body and wrap around wooden beams, bars, the ceiling, and even Soiken's and Shosetsu's necks.
Shosetsu tries to get it off but Soiken tells him to leave it.
As Ocho is suspended upside-down, electrical charges flow through the hair.
Soiken calls for Satan to come out and for Shiro Amakusa to come out.
Ten fingers push out of Ocho's mouth and wiggle about.
Then a long split cuts from inside her body and a naked, silver-haired Shiro pushes his way out.
As Shiro forces his way out, he rips Ocho into many pieces.
The hair strands that kept Ocho suspended, untangle and retreat to Shiro as he lowers himself to the ground.
Shiro shrieks and green energy shoots from his body into the air and descends onto the three resurrecteds: Botaro, Mataemon, Inshun.
After charging-up, the four jump through the ceiling.
The moon returns to normal.
Somewhere else, Jubei is walking through the woods when suddenly there is a strong gust of wind which cuts his cheek, causing him to bleed.
Musashi is still drawing, when a sudden breeze blows out the candle.
A drop of blood falls on his page.
There is a street festival going on that night, with hundreds of people in attendance.
Botaro is standing in the crowd.
He draws his sword and begins slicing randomly, cutting men, women and kids in half.
As people start fleeing, Mataemon races through the crowd, hacking people with his sword.
Inshun carries a staff with a boomerang blade on the top.
He flings the blade into the air and it cuts through many people before returning to his staff.
Some persons try fleeing from the spinning blade but are too slow.
Shiro, who can use his hair for attacks, extends his hair to impale and slice-up persons.
Dozens of men, women and kids are killed and their bodies and heads staked for display.
Soiken laughs and declares that hell is unleashing its force.
The show ends with the 4 resurrecteds jumping into the air one by one.
It is the late 1970s, and smuggler David Swansey  specialises in importing goods to war-torn Southern Rhodesia, defying international sanctions imposed on the doomed nation.
Swansey is eventually contracted by the Ian Smith administration to arrange an illicit purchase of American-made Iroquois helicopters for counter-insurgency operations against black African nationalists.
However, word of his plan soon reaches the latter, who apply strong political pressure to kill the deal in its cradle - the aircraft shipment in question is impounded upon reaching neighbouring South-West Africa.
Meanwhile, one of the many indigenous guerillas resisting the white supremacist policies of the Rhodesian regime is Gideon Marunga , veteran combatant and reluctant participant in atrocities directed against unarmed civilians by his fellow insurgents.
Marunga discovers that Swansey, with the aid of the Rhodesian Security Forces and South African sympathizers, hopes to lead an armed raid on the airfield where the Iroquois are being temporarily held - with the intention of stealing them across the border into Rhodesia.
On the day of the assault, Marunga arrives at the airfield and stalls the attacking troopers, while his accomplices succeed in destroying some of the helicopters.
In the firefight which ensues he comes face to face with Swansey, and the two men subsequently share a weary moment of reflection on their stalemate.
Both abruptly part ways; the smuggler permits his enemy to escape unarmed into the night.
As word of the foiled transaction spreads, Swansey finds himself unable to continue conducting business on the global scale and is restricted to Rhodesia, where he faces conscription into active duty with the armed forces.
The film's storyline closes as Marunga and Swansey confront each other on the battlefield again - this time through the sights of their rifles.
